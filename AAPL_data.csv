2024-05-23,Opera: Best Of Both Worlds? Low PEG Ratio And High Dividend Yield,"Opera Limited is a smaller technology company developing a better web browser for the world, especially gamers, with 300+ million active users.
The European Union's promotion of competition in the browser space is boosting Opera's long-term outlook and driving strong business growth.
OPRA's low valuation, high-growth rate, and extraordinary 6% dividend yield make it an appealing investment option.

2024-05-23,3 Blue Chip Stocks That You Can Buy and Hold for Years,"There are many stocks that you can invest in for the long haul and effectively forget about. These are businesses with robust financials, strong growth prospects, and a lot of stability for investors. They are what you would consider to be blue chip stocks.
Three of the best blue chip stocks to buy, whether you're a seasoned investor or new to Wall Street, are Walmart (NYSE: WMT) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , and Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) . Here's a closer look at these stocks to see why they can make for solid investments in the long run.
It's hard to imagine a scenario where big-box retailer Walmart isn't a huge force in the future. The company recently released its first-quarter earnings for fiscal 2025, with consolidated revenue of $161.5 billion (for the period ending April 30) rising by 6% year over year.",1

2024-05-23,Could This Bull Market Buy Help You Become a Millionaire?,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has helped many investors become millionaires or at least generate a significant amount of wealth over the years. The maker of the iPhone, Mac, and other popular products has grown earnings over time, and that's prompted share-price performance. For example, Apple, including dividend payments, has climbed more than 900% over the past decade.
In recent times, though, declining demand from China has weighed on earnings growth, and investors have seen Apple as slower than other tech companies to invest in the high-growth area of artificial intelligence (AI). As a result, the tech giant's shares have lagged behind; this year, they've hardly changed so far.
Still, Apple over time has proven it's a growth company you can count on, and a top buy during bull markets and beyond. So could this bull market buy help you become a millionaire in the coming years as it's done for others in the past? Let's find out.",1

The release showed 131% revenue growth and 202% earnings growth, both well ahead of expectations.
PDD Holdings' previous earnings release beat expectations, but the stock still crashed. The trading after today's release was lukewarm.
Some factors in PDD Holdings' release, such as cash flows, suggest that the company's earnings quality and sustainability might not be great.
In this article, I explore why I remain bullish on PDD Holdings ahead of earnings, and why I am downgrading my rating to ""buy"" despite my continued bullishness.
PDD Holdings Inc. ( PDD ) just released its earnings for the first quarter. The release showed a 131% increase in revenue and a 202% increase in adjusted EPS. Both figures exceeded analysts' expectations by wide margins. The EPS growth in particular was nearly double what analysts expected. The stock, however, achieved just minor gains after the release came out. As I will show in a later paragraph, the tepid reaction to all of this explosive growth was not necessarily irrational, as there was plausible cause to question the earnings figure reported....",1

2024-05-22,Here's Why I Wouldn't Touch Apple Stock With a 10-Foot Pole,"For years, Apple 's (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock was a bedrock position in many people's portfolios. The company's growth, combined with the relative value of the stock, made it a no-brainer, and investors have been rewarded as a result. Over the past five years, Apple is up around 300% while the S&P 500 increased around 100%.
Any investor should be satisfied with this level of broader market outperformance, but those days may be over. The two factors (growth and value) that made Apple so compelling years ago no longer exist today. As a result, I wouldn't touch Apple stock with a 10-foot pole.
First, I'll tackle Apple's growth aspect. Apple's largest product line, the iPhone, has matured over the past decade. In earlier generations, each annual technological leap made it feasible to upgrade from year to year. This technological leap has narrowed, and consumers aren't as likely to upgrade as frequently. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended March 30), Apple's iPhone sales fell nearly 11% year over year.",1

2024-05-21,3 ETFs to Buy Now: May 2024,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Investors can outperform the market by picking the right ETFs instead of monitoring dozens of stocks. ETFs offer exposure to numerous corporations and often follow a theme. For instance, some ETFs prioritize large-cap companies in the United States, while others allocate their capital toward international small-cap stocks.
Investors can choose from many funds, but it’s important to look at historical returns and current holdings. Looking at these details can help you determine the top ETFs to buy now. These are some of the most promising funds available.
iShares US Technology ETF (IYW)
The iShares US Technology ETF (NYSEARCA: IYW ) gives investors exposure to U.S. tech companies. The fund’s top positions are the Magnificent Seven stocks. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) make up more than 45% of the fund’s total assets.
If those three stocks continue to perform well, IYW should have no issue with outperforming the stock market. The fund has done just that over several years. IYW has an annualized return of 20% over the past decade. The iShares US Technology ETF also has a responsible 0.40% expense ratio.
Although most of the fund’s capital is allocated across a few stocks, the fund has more than 100 holdings. It has a heavy focus on tech, with Software & Services representing 40% of total assets. Semiconductors are right behind it with a 30% position in the fund. Tech hardware and media are the other two sectors within the fund. The remaining sectors each have less than 1% of the fund’s total assets. If you like tech stocks, you’ll enjoy IYW.
Schwab US Large-Cap Growth ETF (SCHG)
Source: iQoncept / Shutterstock
The Schwab US Large-Cap Growth ETF (NYSEARCA: SCHG ) uses the Dow Jones US Large-Cap Growth Total Stock Market Index as its benchmark. The fund offers exposure to large-cap U.S. equities and diversifies its holdings across 250 stocks.
SCHG has the same top three holdings as IYW but with lower concentrations. Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia make up more than 30% of the fund’s total assets. The fund is up by 15% year-to-date and has an annualized return of 15% over the past five years. Investors will keep most of their gains, as the fund only has a 0.04% expense ratio.
Investors will also receive steady cash flow from SCHG. It has a 30-day SEC yield of 0.37%. Almost half of the fund’s total assets are in the Information Technology sector. The next three sectors are Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary and Health Care. Each of these sectors has around 10% or more of the fund’s total assets.
Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF (XLG)
Source: SWKStock / Shutterstock
The Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF (NYSEARCA: XLG ) takes an innovative approach to the S&P 500 . Instead of having the top 500 profitable corporations based on market cap, XLG only holds the top 50 stocks within the index.
This methodology gives XLG investors outsized exposure to the Magnificent Seven stocks. It’s a common theme among the top-performing index funds and ETFs. Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia make up more than 30% of the fund’s total assets. More than 40% of the fund’s assets are in the Information Technology Sector. Communication Services, Health Care, Consumer Discretionary and Financial each consist of around 10% or more of the fund’s total assets.
XLG has a 30-day SEC yield of 0.90% and an expense ratio of 0.20%. Distributions are paid out quarterly in March, June, September and December. The fund has performed well and has an annualized return of around 15% over the past five years.

2024-05-21,3 Reasons Not to Waste Your Time on Apple Stock This Year,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Apple ‘s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) share price has only just started to recover after a poor start to the year. During mid-April, the tech giant’s stock price had fallen by more than 14%. The lack of demand for consumer technology products after COVID-19 precipitated a glut of them and the subsequent rise of inflation are just a couple of reasons why AAPL has underperformed its $1-trillion-dollar market cap peers.
Since the start of May until the end of last Friday’s trading session, Apple shares have rallied nearly 14%. However, investors, particularly retail investors, should not be fooled by this stock price surge. The iPhone-maker has a number of risks facing its sales and net income growth.
The outlook for consumer tech products is still grim
A few weeks ago, Apple released its second quarter earnings report for fiscal year 2024 and markets reacted positively. The announcement of the largest share buyback program in the iPhone-maker’s history as well as its apparent optimism on long-term growth seemed to have elated analysts, investors, and traders alike. However, if we glean closely at the company’s financial figures, there is little materially to be excited about.
Total quarterly revenue continued to fall – this time by 4% – to $90.8 billion. In particular, Apple’s product revenue, which includes iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks, fell by nearly 10% on a year-over-year basis. While services revenue was able to accelerate by 14% from the same period in 2023, analysts don’t put a lot of weight into that segment, driving the company’s long-term growth.
Inflation remains elevated and so do real interest rates. These macroeconomic factors coupled with the points that the consumer electronics market is full of sophisticated competitors and is facing market glut will lead to a continued diminution of sales figures for the near and medium terms and perhaps even in the long term.
Apple’s “China problem” has only magnified
Undergirding much of Apple’s woes are developments in the world’s second-largest economy, China. The country’s technology champion, Huawei, released the Mate 60 Pro in September, with a system-on-a-chip (SoC) designed and manufactured in China. This sent a strong message to not just Apple but also U.S. policy officials that their consecutive rounds of sanctions had inadvertently created a rising domestic semiconductor ecosystem in China. The recent Huawei Pura 70 is the latest success the company has shown the world in its fight to overcome U.S. sanctions.
What has happened in the meantime is Apple has lost a significant amount of market share to Huawei in China. At the end of the first quarter of 2024, the iPhone-maker lost its spot as the top-selling handset brand in China as both Huawei and Honor, once a Huawei brand, took the top spots. In particular, Honor’s market share sat around 17.1% while Huawei’s climbed to 17%.
These developments in China must not be understated because they will have a significant impact on Apple’s long-term sales and net income growth.
Apple lacks a long-term product strategy
Let’s be clear. Apple generates tens of billions of dollars in profits for shareholders each year. However, despite being an obvious cash cow, the lack of a coherent strategy to deploy that cash to tractable products is leading to the iPhone maker’s lethargic decline. There is a lot of hope from analysts that Apple’s new M4 chip which will eventually go into new MacBooks will increase the tech firm’s lagging sales growth. Of course, that has yet to be seen. A lot of the demand for AI products tends to be on the enterprise side, especially if we look at cloud companies that manage large data centers. An AI-enhanced MacBook might spark a lot of consumer interest, but will consumers start pouring back into Apple products because of it? That I’m not confident about.
There is also a number of failed projects, such as the defunct Apple Car and the failed in-house wireless modem, which should also leave investors skeptical about the company’s ability to successfully drive innovation.
At the end of the day, the iPhone-maker needs a series of innovative products to spur growth in the long run. Whether it can deliver remains up in the air for now.

Apple® and Île-de-France Mobilités today introduced an easy, secure, and private way for customers to add a new Navigo card to Apple Wallet® and purchase passes to ride transit in the Paris region. Riders can buy passes from the Île-de-France Mobilités iOS app or directly from Apple Wallet, and use an iPhone® or Apple Watch® to tap and ride. Additionally, beginning this week, real-time transit information in Apple Maps is available in Paris to help users navigate their travels throughout the city.
This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240521622614/en/

“In the lead-up to what will surely be an amazing summer for the Paris region, we’re thrilled to bring Navigo cards to Apple Wallet and provide Parisians and visitors with an incredibly convenient and secure way to ride transit in Paris and explore the city,” said Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. “Users will love the safety, security, and seamlessness of purchasing passes and riding with a Navigo card in Apple Wallet on iPhone and Apple Watch.”
Add a New Navigo Card to Apple Wallet and Buy a Transit Pass
Starting today, users can quickly and easily add a new Navigo card to Wallet by opening the Wallet app, tapping the Add (+) button, selecting “Transit Card,” and following the instructions. With a Navigo card in Apple Wallet, users no longer need to visit a ticket vending machine or reload a Navigo card at retailers, as they can purchase any pass from the Île-de-France Mobilités iOS app or select passes in Apple Wallet. Riders can purchase t+, t+ reduced price, OrlyBus, RoissyBus tickets, and Navigo Day passes in Apple Wallet by selecting their Navigo card of choice, tapping the More (…) button, and selecting “Buy Passes.”
Tap to Ride with Navigo Card in Apple Wallet
Navigo cards in Apple Wallet allow for an easy and convenient commuting experience. Users can easily select their Navigo card from Apple Wallet and double-click the side button, or if they have Express Mode enabled, a user can simply hold their iPhone or Apple Watch near a reader to ride transit in Paris without having to unlock or wake up their device. 1 With power reserve on iPhone, if a customer’s device needs to be charged, they can still use it to ride transit. 2
Security and Privacy
Navigo cards in Apple Wallet take full advantage of the privacy and security built into iPhone and Apple Watch. Navigo cards stored in Apple Wallet are private and secure, and Apple never tracks users’ journeys. When customers add a Navigo card to Apple Wallet, the card information is encrypted and securely stored in the Secure Element, an industry-standard, certified chip designed to store the information safely on the device. If a user’s iPhone or Apple Watch is misplaced, the owner of the device can promptly use the Find My® app to lock and help locate the device.
Real-Time Transit Updates in Apple Maps
Also beginning this week, real-time transit information is available in Apple Maps for the Paris metro, RER, Paris tramway, RATP buses, and more. With real-time transit in Maps, users in Paris can see detailed schedules, live departure and arrival times, and system connections to help plan a journey. Apple Maps will now also offer users in Paris important real-time transit information such as outages and delays.
Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, AirPods, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro.

1 Express Mode requires iPhone XR or later, or Apple Watch Series 6 or later. Only one Navigo card can be enabled with Express Mode at a time. Additional cards must be manually selected.
2 Power reserve is available on iPhone XR or later. Express Mode becomes unavailable when the device is powered off.

2024-05-21,Retire in Style: 3 Stocks to Buy Now for a Plush Future,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
If you’re looking to retire comfortably with a jumbo-sized nest egg, focus on businesses that raise the bar on themselves. In the age of generative artificial intelligence ( AI ), I’d look out for companies that adapt quickly to unlock substantial benefits.
Indeed, AI stands to benefit more than just the tech firms investing billions into chatbots or large language models ( LLM s). Also, enterprise users of such technologies will see some productivity gains and perhaps even cost savings.
Either way, AI is one of those emerging technologies you can’t ignore. So, let’s examine three stocks that can adapt to the new age and perhaps help you achieve a fairly plush future.
Walmart (WMT)

Big-box retailer Walmart (NYSE: WMT ) hasn’t only adapted to the digital age. It is starting to become an innovator in its own right. After the incredible quarterly print that sent WMT stock soaring over 7% in a single trading session, the big question is this. Just how much of a historical premium should investors be willing to pay?
At 27.7 times trailing price-to-earnings ( P/E ), WMT is definitely on the higher end for a retailer known for rock-bottom prices. Part of the premium can be attributed to Walmart is offering customers great deals at a time when it’s hard to stay within one’s weekly grocery budget. After all, it’s not hard to imagine that inflation is to thank for the recent sales surge.
In a recent conference call, Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) Doug McMillion stated the recent quarter was “not inflation-driven results.” And that his firm is poised to continue growing “whether the environment is inflationary or deflationary.”
Consumers continue to regard Walmart as the cheapest place to shop, regardless of where prices are heading. As Walmart rolls back on prices , expect sales to swell even further, especially if rivals can’t keep up with price cuts.
Apple (AAPL)

Those who ditched Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) may be kicking themselves right about now. The stock is now up more than 15% in the past month.
Wall Street’s narrative was that Apple was “falling behind” in the AI race. And, with a lack of a new hit product (it’s looking like the first version of Vision Pro won’t fit the bill), the firm was poised for sub-par growth.
With Apple’s upcoming WWDC24 event June 10-14, the degree of renewed investor enthusiasm is almost palpable.
Sure, a handful of big-tech firms have already had their chance to wow crowds with their latest generative AI powers.
Nevertheless, investors seem more than willing to give the Vision Pro maker the benefit of the doubt again. Consider the potential for OpenAI to share the stage at WWDC24. Only time will tell if OpenAI and Apple announce something substantial. If they do, AAPL stock may be looking at a new all-time high for the summer.
Home Depot (HD)

Home Depot (NYSE: HD ) is down almost 15% from its 52-week high and 19% from its 2021 all-time high. As well-managed as Home Depot is, it still hasn’t been able to fly clear of industry headwinds. After a turbulent recent quarter, the company noted that home improvement demand faces challenges. And, the firm has to deal with the uncertainty of consumer purchasing habits.
Indeed, volatility has the potential to swing both ways. And in due time, Home Depot will find itself flying with the wind at its back again. Until then, the company faces lower expectations for future quarters, making it a potentially decent time to punch one’s long-term ticket.
Until the tides turn, Home Depot can unlock further efficiencies across operations with a helping hand from AI . Such efficiencies should help the firm make the most of the next cyclical upswing in home improvement projects. For now, the stock looks like a decent value post-Q1 at just 23.1 times trailing P/E.

2024-05-21,3 Sectors That Will Suffer Most From the Biden China Tariffs,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
After looking at China’s trade tactics under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, the Biden government is raising taxes on $18 billion of Chinese imports. China is accused of “unfair” trade practices, especially regarding intellectual property, technology transfer, and subsidies. Several sectors are at risk from these Biden China tariffs.
With taxes put on Chinese goods in 2018, President Donald Trump ignited the trade war. A 25% tariff was placed on $34 billion in products, rising to roughly $360 billion by 2019. These tariffs targeted many commodities.
In January 2020, China promised to buy $200 billion more U.S. products and services under a Phase One trade pact over two years. With this accord, the U.S. suspended proposed tariffs and reduced some current ones.
While keeping the taxes that were in place under Trump, the Biden government is introducing new ones worth billions to protect U.S. industry and stop market abuse in areas like electric cars, electronics, and solar energy.
For investors, it’s important to consider the sectors at risk from the Biden China tariffs. The new taxes have raised costs, hurting U.S. businesses like technology and the car industry.
Sectors at Risk from Biden China Tariffs: Technology Sector
Electric vehicles, or EVs, solar cells and panels, lithium-ion batteries, and semiconductor chips are among the tech sectors most at risk from the Biden China tariffs, as rumors circulate regarding the possible revocation of China’s status as a “most favored nation” for trade.
On the EV end, the tariffs are set to increase from 27.5% to 102.5% in 2024 to counteract the flooding of low-cost cars into the U.S. market, which doesn’t bode well for Chinese EV startups looking to make inroads into America.
Meanwhile, the tax on solar cells and panels will go from 25% to 50% , which is meant to limit Chinese production of solar panels, pushing down prices worldwide.
Lithium-ion EV batteries will have their tariffs raised from 7.5% to 25% , with the same to happen with non-EV batteries in 2026.
Major tech conglomerates like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will suffer as a result of these policies. Apple immediately started production in China when it joined the WTO and remains particularly reliant on China for the supply of semiconductor chips. A shortage of these chips led to the first revenue miss for the FAANG stock since 2018, reducing revenue by roughly $6 billion.
Automotive Industry
Previous tariffs on Chinese EVs were 25%. Along with the 2.5% levy on all foreign-made autos, the total was 27.5%. However, the tariff on Chinese EVs will increase to 100%, quadrupling from the previous rate, making it one of the sectors most at risk from the Biden China tariffs.
The tariffs do not bode well for Chinese automakers trying to make a mark in North America. For instance, Nio (NYSE: NIO ) plans to enter the North American market by 2025 and is doing homework regarding showrooms and manufacturing facilities.
On the other hand, BYD (OTCMKTS: BYDDF ) manufactures automobiles in Mexico to take advantage of USMCA tariff relief if they fulfill local standards. BYD’s Seagull is a compact hatchback with a range of up to 250 miles; the basic model costs around $10,700 , about one-third of the price of the least expensive EV available in the U.S.
In China, Volvo is part of the Geely group. These companies are trying to determine how the taxes will affect their cars, like the Polestar 2 luxury electric vehicle and the Volvo S90 hybrid SUV.
Chinese steel and metal are essential to car-making in the States, but the White House wants to raise taxes from 0–7.5% to 25% . According to the CHIPS and Science Act, Chinese chip taxes will also double in 2025.
Consumer Goods
The new tariffs affect $18 billion worth of imports from China, and consumer goods not covered under the Trump administration’s tariffs are also coming under the radar, affecting innumerable U.S. enterprises.
For instance, Walmart (NYSE: WMT ) imports electronics, apparel, and household products from China; tariffs will raise prices, which means higher customer prices and lower margins for Walmart. Walmart will find these tariffs will detract from its solid momentum this year, thanks to a 3-to-1 stock split in February and healthy Q1 e-commerce sales growth of 22%.
Similar to Walmart, Target (NYSE: TGT ) purchases a large amount of goods from China, including clothing, gadgets, and household products. Although Target sources from over 30 different origins , the bulk of its imports come from China, putting it in a precarious position, like other retailers, due to the tariffs; it has five Mainland China offices , with its origins in the country dating back to 1994 in Shanghai.
Moreover, many of Nike’s (NYSE: NKE ) clothing and footwear come from China. Tariffs will raise expenses, which might result in lower profitability. This is not the best news for NKE stockholders after the company said it anticipates a dip in sales during the first half.

2024-05-21,Worldwide Takeover: 3 Stocks Poised for Global Domination,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Consider buying these stocks if you want your portfolio to grow!
The global stock market is undergoing profound transformations right now, with the rapid globalization of traditional companies, as well as the decentralization of the world’s largest companies, with many rising out of Asia, as opposed to the 20th and 21st centuries, which saw a great increase in companies which arose in the West.
Today, I have focused on three stocks that I think have great potential in both the domestic and international markets and offer great solutions to various global problems. Additionally, all these companies have great growth potential, making them great stocks poised for global dominance.
Here are three stocks that I think you should invest in:
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM ) is a semiconductor manufacturer offering international access to chip fabrication and engineering services, being best known for manufacturing chips for industry giants such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ). TSM is trading at $153+ with a market cap of ~$680 billion.
Revenue estimates are stable, ranging from $19.74 to $20.01 billion for this quarter. Additionally, TSM regularly beats estimates, with EPS surprising investors by 4.50% last quarter. Revenue and earnings held still, with quarterly YoY revenue growth of 16.50% , and quarterly YoY earnings growth at 8.90%.

The semiconductor sector has a projected CAGR of 12.2% until 2029. However, factors such as market volatility, supply and demand shocks, and geopolitical tensions could cause this growth to stagnate. To mitigate these risks, TSM is diversifying its factories out of East Asia and into more stable countries, which is why this stock is a buy.
Celsius (CELH)

Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH ) develops, processes, markets, distributes and sells functional energy drinks and liquid supplements in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and internationally.
CELH stock has seen year-over-year (YoY) quarterly revenue growth of 36.80% with an overall revenue of 1.41 billion dollars . Like TSM stock, Celsius regularly beats estimates, and EPS surprised investors by 42.10% last quarter. Celsius Holdings has had a profit margin of 18.63% along with an operating margin of 23.39% which further solidifies its appeal as a stock poised for global domination.
The global energy drink market is still a growth market anticipated to outpace economic expansion by a wide margin. Celsius has to face some fierce competitors – companies like Red Bull and Monster. But great financials, an innovative product line, and plans to go international make CELH stock a must-buy.
ServiceNow (NOW)

ServiceNow Inc. (NYSE: NOW ) provides end-to-end intelligent workflow automation platform solutions for digital businesses in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific and internationally. Currently, it is trading at ~$771, with a market cap of ~$158 billion.
NOW stock has quarterly earnings growth of 131.30% and a huge positive operating cash flow of $3.84 billion . This has led analysts to set a price target of $860.88, representing a 12.5% growth potential. This is combined with the fact that both earnings and revenue have seen steady growth over the last few years.
Additionally, NOW has started to expand hiring by increasing the number of Salesforce employees it hires; with Salesforce being its biggest competitor. Stealing high-quality workers, great financials, and the opportunity to grow in an international market make this top-rated technology growth stock a buy.

2024-05-21,Intel Stock is an AI Play You Can Skip Out On,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) may capitalize on the generative AI trend, but Intel stock has moved the other way so far this year. It’s uncertain if the chip maker will find success in producing AI-compatible chips for the PC market.
Add in other risks, and there may not be enough in play to counter the key issue that weighs on shares. With this, forget about any sort of “fear of missing out” with INTC. The big fear here is the fear of getting stuck holding the bag.
Intel Stock: Bouncing Back But Still Trending Lower
During March and April, INTC experienced a steady slide in price, from around $45 to around $30 per share. The general sell-off in AI stocks during this time of course played a role in this. However, his big decline was in large part due to some discouraging news out of the company.
First, in early April, Intel admitted that its turnaround, which relies heavily on the company becoming a major chip foundry, will not really start to play out until later this decade .
Second, later in them month, Intel released its latest quarterly results. While beating on earnings, Intel’s revenue for the quarter fell short of consensus estimates.
Worse yet, the company provided very underwhelming guidance for the current quarter. Focusing on this major negative, investors bid down Intel stock in response. Yes, since the April 25 earnings release, shares have bounced back, albeit slightly.
Investors have reacted positively to the latest news regarding Intel’s global buildout of its chip manufacturing capacity . However, while inching higher in the short-term, INTC remains on a long-term downward trajectory.
It may be able to hold at or near present price levels for now, but not for long.
Why the Dust has Not Necessarily Settled
With Intel stock finding support at $30 per share, it may seem as though it has finally bottomed out, and that a rebound will continue. After all, take a look at 2025 earnings forecasts.
The sell-side expects Intel’s earnings to nearly double next year, from $1.10 per share to $2.01 per share. This consensus forecast suggests that AI-PC growth will help mitigate the impact of the foundry buildout. However, these forecasts may overly aggressive.
As mentioned above, while Intel may be moving aggressively into the AI-PC chip market, Intel’s success in this market could fall short of expectations. Why? Competition, and not only competition from the likes of its more cutting edge direct competitors. As we pointed out in a prior article on Intel, Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) AI-PC chips, designed in-house, could give competing chips a run for their money.
If underwhelming success in AI-PC chips is coupled with, say, further headwinds stemming from the U.S.-China trade war , it may prove difficult for 2025 results to meet expectations. In the event this scenario becomes more likely to play out, the market could do yet another downward revision to INTC’s valuation.
The Verdict: More Declines Remain Very Possible
Following the sell-off, investors are no longer pricing-in the foundry catalyst so strongly, but the AI-PC chips catalyst remains well baked into the valuation. In the months ahead, this could change, driving Intel down back to its multi-year lows in the mid-$20s per share.
Alongside downside risk in the short run, is the risk of subpar returns in the long-run. Given how long its going to take for Intel to possibly make a full exit out of its slump, shares could underperform peers in a big way over the next few years.
Whether you bought in before its short-lived late 2023 hot run, or if you’ve “bought the dip” in recent months, we reiterate that there’s little need to maintain an Intel stock position right now.

2024-05-21,MSFT Alert: Buy Microsoft Stock Before the Next Move Higher,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
While it has traded sideways over the past few months, it likely won’t be long before Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) stock makes its next move higher. So far this year, Microsoft stock has risen 13%, which is only slightly better than the 12% increase in the benchmark S&P 500 index.
The shares have stagnated after Microsoft achieved a $3 trillion market capitalization in late January, surpassing Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) to become the world’s biggest publicly traded company. With its leadership in AI, Microsoft stock is likely to gain momentum in the near-term.
AI Features
Microsoft recently teased several new artificial intelligence tools for use with its Windows operating system and its cloud-computing infrastructure. Analysts expect more details at Microsoft’s annual Build conference at the end of May.
Media reports say that Microsoft plans to announce a new advanced Paste feature for Windows that will allow people to run AI models directly on their personal computer (PC) rather than send data to the cloud.
Earlier this year, Microsoft introduced new Surface PCs that feature a Copilot button for quick access to the company’s AI chatbot. Microsoft will discuss Windows apps accessing new AI features at the Build conference. The company plans to introduce AI safety features to reduce chatbot security risks and improve the Copilot chatbot.
These are just the latest ways in which Microsoft is cementing its global leadership in the red-hot field of AI. The company also continues to have a close relationship with privately held OpenAI , which it has invested more than $10 billion into.
OpenAI recently announced new AI plans of its own, including an artificial intelligence-powered search engine aimed at competing against Google and a partnership with social media company Reddit (NYSE: RDDT ).
Growth on All Fronts
Microsoft continues to report financial results that show growth on all fronts at the company. In particular, the company’s first-quarter print showed accelerating growth in cloud-computing.
The company’s Intelligent Cloud segment, including the Azure public cloud, earned $26.71 billion in revenue during the quarter. That was up 21% from the previous year and ahead of the $26.26 billion expected among analysts. Revenue from Azure alone grew 31% from a year ago.
Other highlights from the earnings report include revenue from the Xbox video game unit rising 62% year-over-year due to a lift from its $68 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard , which makes popular game titles such as “Call of Duty.”
Sales of Windows licenses to device makers rose 11%. During the quarter, Microsoft began selling access to the Copilot chatbot for small businesses with Microsoft 365 productivity software subscriptions.
The strong earnings and growth across multiple business segments is why 33 professional analysts currently rate MSFT stock a strong buy with a median price target of $491.56 per share, which is 17% higher than where the shares currently trade.
Buy Microsoft Stock
Microsoft stock hasn’t lit the world on fire lately. The stock will likely move higher as AI technologies, cloud-computing and video games contribute to its growth.
Analysts remain bullish on Microsoft and its future outlook, and the company’s strength has led it to become the world’s most valuable publicly traded company. Investors should keep the faith. Microsoft stock is a buy .

2024-05-20,Ride Out the Turbulence: 3 EV Stocks to Own for Massive Wealth Creation,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Reportedly, the death of electric vehicles has been overly exaggerated, according to Forbes.com . All of which is creating an opportunity for EV stocks to buy.
They note that “global EV sales could hit 17 million in 2024, meaning more than one in five cars sold worldwide will be electric. Surging demand for clean, cheap EVs across the rest of this decade will completely change the global auto industry. By 2035, IEA projects 50% of all cars sold globally will be EVs.”
Plus, in the U.S., EV sales jumped 60% year-over-year from a million in 2022 to 1.6 million in 2023, says MarketWatch.com . They added that California, Florida, Texas and Washington leading the U.S. in EV registrations .
We should also note that sales could improve once the U.S. installs more EV charging stations. Also, when the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates. That being said, investors may want to take advantage of any weakness – especially in EV stocks to buy, such as:
Albemarle ( ALB )
Source: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com
Over the last few weeks, Albemarle (NYSE: ALB ) ran from a low of about $110 to a high of $137.50. Now back to $131.12, it’s starting to pivot higher again. ALB also declared a quarterly dividend of 40 cents a share, payable July 1 to shareholders of record as of June 14.
In addition, with lithium prices finally showing signs of bottoming out, ALB could push aggressively higher. We also have to consider that a significant amount of chaos and fear has been priced into ALB, too.
Also, according to analysts at Canaccord Genuity , lithium prices and related stocks are “poised to rebound by July.” The firm says lithium prices could reach $16,000 per tonne for chemicals, and $1,200 per tonne for spodumene concentrate.
“ Canaccord says it’s more confident in its current view that lithium has bottomed than it was last May due to production prices for lithium carbonate equivalent recently falling across several producers,” says NorthernMiner.com .
Tesla ( TSLA )

It’s time to buy the fear in Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ).
Granted, sales have slipped but it’s still dominating the EV market.
As noted by QZ.com , “While Tesla was out selling 50,000 new EVs, Ford was struggling to hit 10,000 EVs sold in second place. Behind it was Hyundai, which shifted 5,686 electric cars in March and BMW sold 4,246 electric models.”
And, as noted by Bernstein analysts, first-quarter deliveries were dire, but the margins were better than expected. Plus, Elon Musk did hint at newer, cheaper models, and a potentially new mapping partnership with Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ).
In addition, according to Investorplace contributor Chandler Capital , “The struggles for Tesla have been well-documented this year but Wall Street analysts have remained bullish on the future of the company. In April, the stock saw more than 12 buy ratings from analysts including an Overweight rating from Cantor Fitzgerald and a price target of $230.”
While others are still running from TSLA on fear, it’s time to buy that fear.
Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF ( DRIV )
Global X Funds logo. (PRNewsFoto/Global X Funds)
Or, if you want greater exposure autonomous and electric vehicle (EV) stocks at less cost, look at the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (NASDAQ: DRIV ).
The last time I highlighted opportunity in the DRIV ETF, it traded at $23.22 on April. Now at $24.70, it could potentially test $27 next. From here, if EV sales momentum can improve; if we see more charging stations installed; and if the Federal Reserve does cut interest rates, electric vehicle stocks and ETFs, like DRIV could accelerate to higher highs.
That is, if it can break above strong, current resistance at $25.  With an expense ratio of 0.68%, the ETF currently invests in 45 stocks involved in the development of autonomous vehicle technology, electric vehicles and EV components and materials.
Some of its top holdings include Nvidia, Toyota (NYSE: TM ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Tesla, and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) to name a few.

And I think that there's a couple of building blocks. I'm just getting to your question, a couple of building blocks that can keep you sane in following the market and not get you crazy. One is fundamentals. Two is technicals. And maybe under technicals, or maybe its own category, I call action. So, fundamentals, are earnings moving up? Is the economy doing well, right? That's its own thing. Is the Fed getting in the way or not? Or is the Fed letting the economy go? That's all called fundamentals, right?...",2

2024-05-20,Why Taiwan Semiconductor Stock Is an Unstoppable Juggernaut to Bet On,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
There is no stopping Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM ). The world’s largest pure play semiconductor foundry really has too much demand for its capacity and will be flush with growth for years to come. Despite the excess of good fortune showering down on Taiwan Semiconductor stock, shares are not overvalued.
TSM stock is undervalued, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 20 and a sales multiple of less than 2. With sales growing at 16.5% CAGR and earnings at 18% CAGR, this is a discounted stock. Wall Street predicts Taiwan Semiconductor to surpass earnings growth, with a 21% CAGR. The stock has already risen 46% in 2024, indicating further growth potential.
A Closer Look at Taiwan Semiconductor Stock
There is no getting around it; Taiwan Semiconductor stock is a behemoth. It supplies 95% of all advanced semiconductors on the market and is the primary supplier to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), as well as other voracious chip consumers.
There are concerns of an imminent slump in the industry after several years of gorging because of artificial intelligence. Chinese foundry Semiconductor Manufacturing International says it will be limiting its capacity expansion in 2025 and beyond as chip prices are expected to fall and customer pre-pull, according to DigiTimes Asia .
Taiwan Semiconductor doesn’t disagree. It recently implied a slowdown was coming to the industry. However, it says its own business won’t be disrupted .
The chipmaker forecasts sales to keep growing in the “low- to mid-20%” range because CEO C.C. Wei says AI demand is “insatiable.” AI will account for low-teen percentages of revenue.
There is also the expansion in the number of companies wanting to make their own chips. Apple, for example, recently said it wants to make computer chips for data centers that are designed to run AI software .
Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) also want to build their own chips. But “build” is a misnomer. It will be TSM that actually makes most of the chips for their designs. So it will have no shortage of business regardless of what is happening elsewhere in the market.
Getting Paid to Expand
While chipmakers like Intel are big beneficiaries of the taxpayer dollars being doled out to massively profitable corporations through the U.S. CHIPS Act, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is also a big winner.
It is investing $65 billion in three new chip factories in Arizona. The first one is scheduled to begin producing 4 nanometer chips beginning in 2025.
A second facility will produce the world’s most advanced 2nm chips starting in 2028, and TSM will get a $25 billion handout from the federal government to build its third factory with production starting in 2030.
Not that there won’t be hiccups. The second plant, for example, is temporarily on hold due to rising costs as inflation keeps charging ahead.
TSM also discovered there is a lack of skilled labor in Arizona that is making it difficult to fill positions at the plant. That won’t get any easier if and when it builds its third factory.
Ascending to a $1 Trillion Valuation
Despite some challenges, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing just keeps growing in size and importance. It also means TSM stock will likely cross the trillion-dollar valuation threshold soon.
The company is currently valued at $790 billion, and with its growth trajectory firmly established, it won’t be long before it joins that elite group of stocks worth $1 trillion or more. Now would be a good time to climb aboard this rocket ride.

2024-05-19,3 Reasons to Buy Apple Stock Like There's No Tomorrow,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) investors have been on a roller coaster in recent years, with an economic downturn bringing the iPhone maker's stock plunging 27% in 2022. The company's shares rebounded 48% the following year. However, repeated hits to its business and revenue declines throughout 2023 have seen its stock dip 1% since the start of this year.
Wall Street has grown wary of Apple's iPhone-dependent business as macroeconomic headwinds caught up with the company, leading to a decline in product sales. However, recent quarterly results and moves to prioritize more digital businesses suggest the company is moving in a better direction.
Apple's digital services segment consistently outpaces the iPhone and is on track to become its highest-earning division. Meanwhile, a gradual expansion into artificial intelligence (AI) could see the company profit from the tailwinds of a $200 billion (and growing) industry for years. As a result, now could be the best time to invest in Apple, as it is at the start of a major shift in its business model.",3

For those who haven’t picked out their Dow 40,000 hats, it’s okay. Yesterday marked the first day ever the Dow Jones Industrial Index pushed above the 40,000 level . It seems like just yesterday we were celebrating 30,000, but alas, that’s a bull market for you.
Today, the Dow Jones is up another 0.2%, within spitting distance of closing above this level. The 40,000 level for this index is a key psychological one , with traders positioning their portfolios accordingly. Higher index levels have been driven by large-cap performance (as is the case with other indices), though the makeup of the Dow is considerably different from the S&P 500 or Nasdaq .
With a focus on more industrial and blue-chip names, this index is often viewed as much more representative of the overall U.S. economy. If the market is gauging things right, perhaps that spells good times ahead.
Let’s dive into what to make of this move, and whether the Dow can end the year above this key level.
Put On Your Dow 40,000 Hats
We’ve yet to see a daily close above 40,000 on the Dow, so today’s price action will certainly be more closely watched by market pundits, traders and investors alike. Like any round number, many put outsized emphasis on where the Dow is currently trading and what may take this index to the 50,000 level down the road.
Consumer spending has remained strong, and the large-cap blue-chip stocks held in this index have certainly benefited from this trend. While less tech-heavy than other indices, it’s worth noting that the Dow does hold key mega-cap tech darlings such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), which happen to be the three largest Dow components by market capitalization.
So, this index isn’t immune to the artificial intelligence ( AI ) related catalysts taking the market higher but is more defensive in nature. It’s also more expensive to buy (via ETFs), meaning big money investors tend to focus on this index over others. That’s something that’s worth noting for retail investors looking to gain exposure to this space.
Over time, the stock market has historically headed higher, and I think it’s just a matter of time for us to celebrate 50,000 on the Dow. How long that will take is anyone’s guess, but this price action is certainly worth paying attention to today.
Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

2024-05-17,Rally Rockets: 3 Stocks Benefitting From the Market's Unstoppable Surge,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Major indices continue to climb Despite ongoing concerns over sticky inflation, high interest rates and geopolitical tensions. Many shares defy the traditional “sell in May and go away” adage. This trend leaves investors wondering which stocks to buy to ride the ongoing surge in equities.
Studies show that the S&P 500 Index has enjoyed 27 bull markets between 1928 and 2023, with an average gain of nearly 115% over an average period of 2.7 years. From 1987 to 2000, the longest bull market achieved an impressive gain of 582%. In June 2023, the S&P 500 re-entered bull market territory, displaying strong momentum. Research provider CFRA recently raised its 12-month target to over 5,600, citing optimistic profit growth expectations.
Although concerns persist about high valuations in the technology sector and the potential volatility surrounding the presidential election in November, market sentiment remains positive. Anticipated interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and earnings growth could create a favorable environment for further gains. Let’s explore three of the best stocks to buy, poised to benefit from the current market momentum.
Eli Lilly (LLY)
Source: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi
Pharma giant Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY ) provides medications across a wide range of therapeutic areas, including diabetes, cancer and chronic pain. Its strong product portfolio, consistent revenue growth, and potential for future breakthroughs make LLY stock the first name on our stock list.
For the first quarter of 2024 , Eli Lilly reported a remarkable 26% increase in revenue, primarily driven by the successful launch of new products like Mounjaro and Zepbound. Wall Street has been impressed with the pharma company’s ability to innovate and effectively bring new products to market.
Meanwhile, its gross margin also saw an impressive rise from 78.4% in the first quarter of 2023 to 82.5% in the first quarter of this year. Eli Lilly benefited from higher prices and an improved product mix, underscoring the company’s operational efficiency and pricing power. Operating income in the same period grew by 63%, and earnings per share increased by 59%. Looking ahead, Eli Lilly has raised its full-year 2024 revenue guidance to between $42.4 billion and $43.6 billion. The company also anticipates further margin expansion.
As a result, LLY stock has advanced 30% year-to-date (YTD), hovering slightly below all-time highs. Yet, the shares are expensive, trading at 56 times forward earnings and 19 times sales. Nonetheless, Wall Street is expecting further gains from the pharma stock , as the 12-month average price stands at $877.50 , presenting an upside potential of 15%.
Fabrinet (FN)
Source: Pixel B / Shutterstock.com
Next on our list of stocks to buy is Fabrinet (NYSE: FN ). Its equipment enables the transmission of massive data volumes at high speeds. With data demand constantly rising and a wide range of services ranging from optical packaging to precision manufacturing, Fabrinet deserves your attention as a long-term investment.
Analysts point out that Fabrinet has demonstrated robust financial health with a market cap of $8.4 billion. In early May, management released financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 . Exceeding guidance, quarterly revenue was $731.5 million, compared to $665.3 million for the same period 12 months ago. Adjusted net income per diluted share was $2.39, compared to $1.94 for the year-ago quarter.
Wall Street was pleased about the growth in optical communications revenues, particularly from datacom revenue, which grew 150% YOY. Management is optimistic about its position in the high data rate datacom market. Fabrinet’s operating and net profit margins currently stand at 9.6 and 9.9%, respectively. In other words, management has successfully navigated the competitive manufacturing landscape to maintain profitability.
Since the start of the year, FN stock has returned 22%, rallying significantly after announcing better-than-expected financial results. Meanwhile, the shares are trading at 26.2 times forward earnings and 3.1 times sales. Given the extent of the recent rally in Fabrinet shares, potential investors may consider waiting for a pullback towards the $220 level. Fabrinet will likely continue its growth trajectory in future quarters, making it a compelling stock to buy within the tech manufacturing sector.
Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG)
Source: SHUN_J / Shutterstock
Large-cap growth stocks typically thrive in rapidly expanding industries like technology and biotech. Known for high growth rates and valuations, these companies are expected to outpace other established stocks. Such growth shares may offer a blend of stability and significant long-term potential, making them an important part of many portfolios.
Therefore, the Vanguard Growth ETF is next on our list of stocks to buy (NYSEARCA: VUG ). This fund allows investors to replicate the performance of leading large-cap U.S. growth stocks. Launched in January 2004, the ETF offers broad exposure to about 200 companies.
Over half of VUG’s holdings are in technology stocks (56%), followed by consumer discretionary (19%), industrials (9%) and healthcare (8%) sectors. The top 10 holdings collectively account for over half of the fund’s net assets of $226 billion. Among the top names are Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) (NASDAQ: GOOG ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) and Visa (NYSE: V ) and others.
Since January, with a gain of over 11%, VUG has outperformed many individual stocks and the benchmark indices. By comparison, the Nasdaq 100 index has advanced 9%, the S&P 500 10%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) 5%. Currently, the VUG fund trades at 38 times trailing earnings and 10 times book value. With a competitive expense ratio of 0.04% and a modest 0.5% dividend yield, VUG remains an appealing option for investors seeking exposure to large-cap growth stocks.

2024-05-16,Brace for a Market Crash With These 3 (Surprising) New Inflation Hedges,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
An inflation hedge protects against currency devaluation caused by rising prices. It involves investing in assets expected to maintain or increase value. Hedging can prevent investment losses due to inflation, which reduces the real return.
For instance, the real return is negative if a stock yields 5%, but inflation is 6%. Inflation-hedged assets may retain high value despite lower intrinsic worth as investors seek them out.
When people talk about their money not stretching as far, they’re referring to inflation affecting their earnings or wealth. Inflation reduces purchasing power, so individuals aim for earnings and investments to outpace it, allowing them to afford more, even with rising prices.
Each state has its own inflation rate, influenced by its economy and fiscal and monetary policies. Inflation can affect specific areas like gas or food costs and comes in three types: demand-pull, cost-push and built-in inflation.
That said, here are three new inflation hedges that people are going crazy about.
Nvidia Is the New Gold
One of the most traditional inflation hedges is gold. It has been a top inflation hedge since 1971; during the Great Recession, gold became so popular despite its volatility and short-term uncertainties. Banks believe that having more gold is better, and thus, they bought more of it in 2022 than in 1967.
Even in 2024, inflation is still an ongoing concern, and it has been causing delays in Fed rate cuts. As per Bloomberg, investors are turning to big tech stocks like the Magnificent Seven. However, gold remains the preferred inflation hedge.
In the latest Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey, respondents viewed significant U.S. tech stocks as a hedge against inflation alongside gold. At the same time, 46% favored gold and nearly a third chose tech giants.
Survey respondents favored tech giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) as the best hedge against inflation, highlighting their dominant role in the U.S. markets. Their steady profits and growth instill investor confidence in continued gains. Though reduced from 2022 highs, inflation still concerns investors, with 59% citing it as the top market risk. The following CPI reading is anticipated to sit at 3.4% year-over-year.
Three years ago, inflation skyrocketed past 2%, and Nvidia surged six times. Other tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) also outperformed the S&P 500 market by 50%. Although, like other tech stocks, they can be sensitive to inflation and changes in inflation rates.
In 2024, Nvidia marked a milestone and surged over 200%. The stock has exceeded $900 per share. In February, it awed the market through its excellent earnings report. The company showed $22 billion in revenue through generative AI and H100 GPUs. It also helped Nvidia get a seat at the trillion-dollar market cap hierarchy.
Investing in Farmlands
Institutional investors historically used agricultural land as an inflation hedge, but it must often be made available to most investors. In 2023, pension funds and tax-exempt vehicles held about 1,331 U.S. farmland properties worth $16.2 billion. Retail investors can access farmland assets through publicly traded REITs like Farmland Partners (NYSE: FPI ) and Gladstone Land (NASDAQ: LAND ).
Farmland historically performs well during high inflation due to its positive correlation and real asset nature. It correlates more strongly with the CPI and Producer Price Index than other investments. Real assets, including farmland, typically outperform traditional assets during inflation, with nominal value growth. Farmland has seen year-over-year price decreases only once since 1987, indicating value preservation despite inflation.
Farmland scarcity serves as a natural inflation hedge. The United States lost over 11 million acres in 20 years, and could still lead to more acres by 2050. Farmland proved otherwise, as it averaged an 11% annual return from years 1992 through 2020. It appreciates while generating operating cash flow, supported by the constant demand for food.
Farmland is a unique real estate investment that provides stable income and resilience across economic cycles. Moreover, the returns from farmland are not correlated with public markets. That makes them unaffected during economic shifts.
Although investing in farmland can be crucial due to decreasing arable land and global population, it is still worth an investment. In fact, regenerative agricultural practices make farmlands look enticing for investors.
Put Up a Chicken Wings Business
Chicken is reclaiming its place as a favorite food choice for Americans. With beef prices increasing, people are opting for more chicken wings at fast-food restaurants and frozen tenders at grocery stores. Meat companies like Tyson Foods (NYSE: TSN ) and Pilgrim’s Pride ( NASDAQ:PPC ) are seeing increased profits from poultry due to rising demand and lower costs for livestock feed.
Retail sales of all U.S. chicken products rose by 3% for the year ending April 21, while pork and beef sales slightly declined. With food spending at a three-decade high, consumers opt for cheaper private-label items and cut back on branded purchases. Tyson executives noted shoppers prioritizing essentials over beef and expensive brands, but the duration of this trend remains to be determined.
Moreover, unstable U.S. cattle supply leads meatpackers like Tyson to pay more for livestock, raising wholesale and retail meat prices. Tyson executives noted ranchers still need to begin rebuilding herds. Ground beef retail prices surged approximately 12% in March compared to a year ago, with Tyson’s CEO attributing strong chicken demand to more discerning consumers.
Fabio Sandri, CEO of Pilgrim’s Pride, noted a shift to cheaper chicken items on restaurant menus. Despite overall restaurant foot traffic declines, Pilgrim’s fast-food chain sales rose 6% in the latest quarter. Shares in the second-largest chicken processor surged approximately 60% over the past year.
Bottom Line
Inflation decreases purchasing power, limiting what one can buy with the same money. That may lead to borrowing or reduced spending on non-essential items. If one’s income keeps up with inflation, there’s less for investments or discretionary spending.
Additionally, inflation may trigger a recession by reducing consumer spending and prompting interest rate hikes to curb inflation, slowing borrowing and business activity.
Common inflation hedges include gold, commodities, a balanced 60/40 stock-to-bond portfolio, REITs, rental income, the S&P 500 and TIPS. Or, you may also want to invest more in Nvidia, farmlands or perhaps put up a chicken wing business while it’s cheap.

Exploring different ways to buy gold.
Quarterly 13-F reports came out this week, requiring institutional investors with more than $100 million in assets to disclose their holdings as of the end of Q1. 13-F reports offer a window into the portfolios of investing legends like Warren Buffett, Bill Ackman and Michael Burry (of The Big Short fame). I'm fascinated with these because the only time valuations were higher than now for large-cap US stocks was the late 1990s tech bubble. Buffett sold some Apple ( AAPL ) and bought Chubb ( CB ), Ackman bought nothing, and Burry disclosed that his biggest purchase was a physical gold fund ( PHYS ). As far as famous hedge fund managers go, Burry is the most flexible of the bunch because of his small AUM and willingness to think outside the box. So why would Burry be interested in gold?

2024-05-16,Shiny Apple? 3 Reasons to Buy and Hold AAPL Stock Forever.,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) saw a 5% decline in 2024, with shares of AAPL stock trading roughly flat on a year-to-date basis. Now, much of this performance has to do with Apple’s recent surge, with the stock dropping more than 15% peak to trough during this year’s decline.
There are ample reasons for investor pessimism towards Apple currently. The company has refreshed some product lines, but it’s uncertain if consumers will feel the need to buy the new iPhone. Negative growth in recent quarters may deter value investors from trading this stock, which is priced at nearly 30-times earnings.
That said, there’s a reason Apple remains a top tech stock investors continue to pile into. The company’s $110 billion share buyback plan boosted stock last week, signaling confidence despite the premium valuation.
Let’s dive into a few other reasons investors remain bulled up on this megacap tech name.
OpenAI and AAPL Stock
Apple appears to be nearing a deal with OpenAI for its iPhone AI technology, causing AAPL stock to rise Monday. Apple aims to integrate this technology into iOS 18, details of which will be unveiled at WWDC starting June 10.
Bloomberg reported Friday that Apple finalized terms to integrate OpenAI’s ChatGPT into iOS 18. Apple also discussed licensing Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: GOOG ) Google’s Gemini AI chatbot. CEO Tim Cook also noted the company’s transformative AI plans during its May 2 conference call.
Wedbush Securities’ Daniel Ives noted adding AI to the iPhone 16 series could drive upgrades. He suggested Apple might monetize AI services through subscriptions, leveraging its vast hardware user base.
Ives anticipated Apple enhancing Siri with OpenAI for complex tasks, potentially as a separate subscription service.
Apple Quartiles
Apple News+ also introduced Quartiles , a new original spelling game, and Offline Mode for subscribers without Wi-Fi or cellular. Available with iOS 17.5, these enhance the News+ experience. Editor-in-chief Lauren Kern highlighted the additions’ convenience and entertainment value.
Quartiles challenges players to create words from tiles with 2 to 4 letters, earning points based on word length. New puzzles are offered daily, and users can share puzzles with other subscribers.
It’s the latest addition to News+’s Puzzles collection. With iOS 17, Apple introduced daily crosswords and mini puzzles for U.S. and Canadian subscribers. A new Puzzles Scoreboard allows subscribers to view personalized stats and streaks.
Possible Partnership with Rivian
On May 6, reports suggested Apple was exploring a partnership, with EV company Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN ) emerging as a top candidate. Although details remain speculative, a collaboration could significantly benefit both companies.
Apple invested $10 billion over a decade in its EV project but scrapped it in early 2024 after multiple failed attempts. With cars becoming advanced computers, Apple sees a chance to diversify its ecosystem and enter the automotive space by partnering with Rivian.
Rivian, struggling financially and losing over $38,000 per car, could benefit from Apple’s brand recognition and expertise, potentially opening new opportunities in the competitive EV market.
A Rivian-Apple collaboration could focus on joint R&D in autonomous driving technology. Rivian’s Driver+ software, requiring driver attention, could benefit from Apple’s financial and technological resources, accelerating progress toward Level 4 or 5 autonomy.
Rivian has the hardware and infrastructure for vehicle production, while Apple could develop the software, making their partnership highly complementary.
AAPL Stock Isn’t Cheap, But for a Reason
Apple’s quarterly results highlighted a historic buyback and sluggish iPhone sales, especially in China. Despite economic challenges and competition, Cook remains optimistic.
While the iPhone faces competition in China, innovations could lead to a resurgence. Overall, Apple’s solid quarter suggests potential for stock growth.
I think long-term investors who have owned AAPL stock forever may simply want to continue holding. While the stock’s valuation is excessive, it’s also true that this is a company that’s worth the premium.
On a capital return basis alone, Apple certainly remains one of the best companies in the world. I don’t think that will change over the next decade.

2024-05-16,3 Warren Buffett Stocks That Look Irresistible Right Now,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B ) portfolio is rich with what the Oracle of Omaha would refer to as “wonderful” businesses. Though Berkshire’s portfolio has skewed away from technology stocks in prior decades, one can’t help but notice that the modern-day Berkshire portfolio has pivoted towards the modern age.
And we’re not just talking about the conglomerate’s massive stake in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Aside from the iPhone maker, which still comprises a huge portion of the overall Berkshire portfolio, even after trimming by 13%, Berkshire owns a sprinkling (less than 1%) in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ).
Apart from Berkshire’s tech-savvy bets, many other holdings within the Berkshire portfolio always stand to gain a lot by investing in technological initiatives. Most notably, American Express (NYSE: AXP ) stands out as a firm that’s equipped to thrive in the data-driven age with its analytics capabilities.
In this piece, we’ll examine three Warren Buffett stocks that look irresistible as they embrace tech to boost long-term growth.
American Express (AXP)

American Express is one of the older holdings within the Berkshire portfolio. Still, unlike other older Berkshire investments that have dragged their feet on the returns front of late, the premier credit card firm has continued to deliver impressive gains. Year-to-date, AXP stock is up more than 28%, thanks in part to some amazing quarters that shot past analyst expectations.
Consumer sentiment could easily get choppier from here as inflation’s impact continues to weigh. That said, American Express looks poised to continue posting solid numbers, as its “spend-centric” model keeps flexing its muscles, even in the face of high inflation and macro headwinds that stand to impact global spending.
Well-of Amex cardholders and spend-happy Millennials, some of whom were brought on just in the past year, do not look to be putting their cards away. As they continue buying a wide range of goods with their Gold and Platinum cards at 2024-era prices, AXP stock certainly stands out as one of the better inflation-fighting stocks in the market. Higher prices on just about everything translate into larger tabs on one’s monthly Amex bill.
Further, given its recent resilience and continued investments in digital transformation, AXP stock still seems a tad undervalued at less than 20 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E).
Visa (V)
Source: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com
Visa (NYSE: V ) is a much smaller holding in the Berkshire portfolio at less than 1% at the time of writing. Indeed, Berkshire and Buffett seem to be fans of the credit card business, and it’s not a mystery as to why. Though V stock hasn’t been nearly as hot, up 7.3%, trailing the market by about 3%, I do view the leading credit card company as worth pursuing after its recent roadbump.
Recently, Piper Sandler started V stock with an overweight rating . The company’s impressive network, which has high barriers to entry around it (a wide economic moat), and tech prowess were major reasons why Piper is a fan of the stock.
Most notably, Piper outlined the potential for generative AI to help “drive upside to fundamentals.” Undoubtedly, Visa is as much a financial technology company as it is a creditcard firm. And you can bet it’s taking generative AI seriously as it seeks to gain any operating or growth edge it can get.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com
Finally, we have the number-one holding in Berkshire’s public stock portfolio. Investors and Buffett followers have plenty of reasons to buy the stock, even if Berkshire is inclined to continue trimming in the near future.
The rest of 2024 could see Apple’s most aggressive push into generative AI yet, with the WWDC24 to begin on June 10, 2024 . Reports suggest the annual multi-day conference could be heavy on generative AI.
Whether it’s as heavy on AI as Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , GOOGL ) Google’s recent I/O 2024 event remains to be seen. Regardless, I’m quite bullish on Apple’s near-term future as it looks to bring the AI tech up a notch for its coming iOS 18. With a ChatGPT deal reportedly close to being inked, AAPL stock may have enough drivers to take it right back to all-time highs of close to $198 per share by year’s end.
At 29.15 times trailing P/E, AAPL stock is getting somewhat frothy again. I view the multiple as worth paying if it means that Siri is going to get a heck of a lot smarter.

2024-05-15,Buffett's Billion-Dollar Biz: 3 Crucial Takeaways From Berkshire's Q1 Results,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
It’s been nearly two weeks since Warren Buffett presided over his company’s annual shareholder meeting in Omaha. The ritual has become a must-attend for those in the industry and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B ) shareholders. There’s no question Berkshire Hathaway stock remains very attractive for long-term investors.
The media’s gone over many of the highlights, so I won’t delve into the events of that weekend in Nebraska. It sounded, as always, like a lot of fun. The biggest downer: Charlie Munger wasn’t there to throw out the usual zingers he’s become known for. Munger will be remembered for years to come.
I’ve always felt that Berkshire is the ultimate mutual fund. This is because it charges no fees, provides healthy long-term returns, and protects against the downside. You will find that this is unlike few stocks in the United States.
If you could only own one stock, besides the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA: SPY ), which Buffett recommends most investors buy, it would be Berkshire Hathaway.
Drawing from the company’s Q1 2024 results, here are three reasons.
It’s a Team Game with Berkshire Hathaway Stock
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
The one thing I love about Berkshire is that it’s like a sports team in that there’s always somebody performing well to drag the rest of the team along, even when they don’t want to. They all sink or swim together.
In the latest quarter, its operating earnings were $11.2 billion , 4o% higher than a year earlier. That’s the figure to look at when studying the company’s quarterly and annual reports.
If you use net earnings, you’ll get wild swings in the results due to investment gains and losses (realized and unrealized) that must be reported each quarter. In Q1 2024, its net earnings were $12.70 billion, 64% lower than a year ago.
There are seven items that make up operating earnings. In the first quarter, BNSF, the company’s railroad business, had operating earnings that were 8.3% lower than a year earlier. The only other item with a decrease was its investments in companies where it doesn’t control a majority, owning between 20% and 50%. Those earnings were almost 29% lower year-over-year.
The good news is these two businesses only accounted for less than 14% of its operating earnings.
There will come a day when both of these businesses outperform their five other stablemates, likely when they are most needed to keep overall earnings growing.
Buffett Sold Apple for a Couple of Reasons
Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com
Berkshire’s Q1 2024 results showed that the company cut its stake in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) by about 13% in the first quarter to 790 million shares. While that’s a significant reduction, it still leaves the company with shares accounting for 40.2% of its $367 million equity portfolio. That’s four times its next largest holding — Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) at 10.9%.
The first reason sold some of its Apple stock was to get more cash. With interest rates still high and stocks overvalued — Apple trades at 28x earnings compared to a multiple between 12 and 20 times earnings when Berkshire acquired most of its AAPL stock — the interest it earns on its $189 billion cash pile is a real incentive to lock-in some gains on its Apple stock.
Who knows? He might buy some more if it drops in the future. However, Berkshire shareholders ought to be happy that he’s lowered the overweight weight Apple has on the entire company’s assets.
Diversification when you’ve got a great team is not a bad thing.
Buffett’s Getting a Faster Trigger Finger
How many years did it take the company to jump off the Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ) bandwagon after it became patently clear that the bank had a broken business model that it is just now getting over the scandals that plagued the company.
In February, the Office of the Controller of the Currency ( OCC ) terminated its consent order , first implemented in September 2016, that forced the company to clean up its act over its sales practices.
“Confirmation from the OCC that we have effectively implemented what was required is a result of the hard work of so many of our employees, and I’d like to thank everyone at Wells Fargo involved for their dedication to transforming how we do business,” stated CEO Peter Scharf in a prepared statement.
Berkshire sold off the last of WFC shares in Q1 2022 , six years after the OCC’s consent orcder went into effect. That’s a long time to stand by a company.
In the case of Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA ), he had no such patience. He said at the annual meeting that he alone decided to sell its entire stake in the troubled firm, crystallizing a significant capital loss for the company.
On the one hand, it’s never good to take a loss. On the other hand, it has significant unrealized gains on its equity portfolio — $232.1 billion at the end of March — to offset these gains.
We don’t know if Buffett was behind the buy but he had no problem taking responsibility for the sale. That’s what you want in an investment manager. The ability to move on when you’ve made a mistake.

Even amidst macroeconomic headwinds, the S&P 500 index has remained resilient. For the year-to-date, the index has trended higher by 10%. While it’s good to remain optimistic, preparing for the worst is equally important. I don’t intend to be a fearmonger and it’s unlikely that there will be a big crash. However, even a 10% to 15% correction in the index is significant. To remain prepared for any such scenario, this column intends to discuss some low-risk, high-reward stocks to buy and hold.
It’s first important to understand the reason for remaining cautious. GDP growth decelerated in Q1 2024, and this calls for rate cuts. However, with stubborn inflation, the Fed will likely be slow in pursuing expansionary policies. Fear of a hard landing will likely be the catalyst for a market correction.
The first-rate cut is likely before the Presidential elections. Therefore, any weakness in the market would be an opportunity to accumulate quality stocks. For now, let’s discuss three low-risk, high-reward stocks to buy.
Panasonic Holdings (PCRFY)
Source: Shutterstock
In my view, Panasonic Holdings (OTCMKTS: PCRFY ) stock is a low-risk bet for two reasons. First, PCRFY stock has already been oversold and has mainly remained sideways in the last 12 months. Considering a forward price-earnings ratio of 8.5, I don’t see a downside from current levels for this 1.26% dividend yield stock.
Further, Panasonic Holdings is among the major players in the EV battery market. The company is high on innovation and has ambitious expansion plans through 2031. Once industry sentiments change, PCRFY stock is likely to deliver multibagger returns.
In terms of expansion plans, Panasonic is targeting to boost its EV battery manufacturing capacity to 200GWh by 2031. This will translate into steady revenue growth coupled with EBITDA margin expansion.
On the innovation front, Panasonic has partnered with Sila Nanotechnologies to “purchase next-generation nano-composite silicon anode material for EV lithium-ion batteries.” By 2031, Panasonic aims to achieve a 25% increase in battery energy density. With all these positives, it’s a good time to buy PCRFY stock.
Apple (AAPL)

The last few quarters have been mixed for technology stocks . Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) stock has surged 215% in the previous 12 months. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock has remained sideways during the same period. In my view, investors can consider some allocation to innovation driven ideas that have remained subdued. Apple is possibly among the best names to consider.
An important point to note is that the application of AI is being talked about across sectors. AI is expected to contribute $15 trillion to the global economy by 2030. I believe the markets are waiting for Apple’s big AI push. Once that’s clear, AAPL stock is likely to surge higher.
Apple ended Q2 2024 with $161 billion in cash and equivalents . This provides ample flexibility to invest in next-generation technology for its devices. Apple has already been making small acquisitions in the AI space. In another recent news, Apple is planning to sell its Vision Pro mixed-reality headset outside the United States. The wearable and services segment has ample scope for growth in the coming years.
Vale (VALE)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
Among blue-chip commodity stocks, Vale (NYSE: VALE ) is worth buying at current levels of $12.5. VALE stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 5.2, indicatinghe extent of undervaluation. The stock also offers an attractive dividend yield of 8.8%.
Regarding potential returns, analysts have a median price target of $16 for the stock. This would imply an upside of 28% from current levels. Therefore, the total return from VALE stock is likely at 35% to 40% in the next 12 months, with valuations indicating limited downside risk.
Vale will benefit from relatively higher iron ore prices from a business perspective. A possible rate cut towards the end of the year can trigger a rally for industrial commodities. This will support revenue and adjust EBITDA upside.
It’s worth noting that for Q1 2024, Vale reported the highest quarterly iron ore production since 2019. Copper and nickel production also witnessed healthy growth. If this trend is sustained, the company will be positioned to deliver strong free cash flows.

2024-05-15,2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever,"Choosing stocks that you never have to sell has enormous advantages. If you choose well, it means you can let the investment compound in value for potentially decades. As Warren Buffett knows all too well, uninterrupted compound interest is the best way to build lasting wealth.
Since 1965, Buffett's investing skills have steered Berkshire Hathaway 's shares to an awe-inspiring return of 4,384,748% through 2023. A key component of those returns was selected investments in stocks of strong companies in its $300-plus-billion equity portfolio. Let's look at two of its top stock holdings that can grow for decades.
Warren Buffett has a long history of betting big on strong consumer brands. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has a loyal customer base that is willing to give up many other things before their iPhones. The stock has returned 531% since Berkshire first started buying the stock in 2016, which brought its stake to a value of $174 billion at the end of 2023.",4

2024-05-15,Berkshire Hathaway Stock Alert: Warren Buffett Could Reveal His Mystery Buy Today,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Conglomerate giant Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A , NYSE: BRK-B ) – which covers a broad range of sectors from insurance to utilities – saw its shares grab the spotlight on Wednesday. Speculation has heightened around a confidential position that Warren Buffett’s enterprise acquired at some point in the second half of 2023. With the disclosure deadline today, the Warren Buffett mystery stock could be revealed soon.
According to Investor’s Business Daily , the conglomerate previously stated during its Q1 earnings report that it reduced a significant position in consumer technology giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) by 13%. It also exited multinational mass media firm Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA ). However, not all of the moves were revealed publicly, which could come in a 13F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) late Wednesday.
The spotlight centers on the so-called Berkshire Hathaway mystery stock. Several Buffett watchers speculate that the security may relate to a financial firm. Per Edward Jones analyst James Shanahan, it could be Charles Schwab (NYSE: SCHW ), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) or American International Group (NYSE: AIG ).
Business publication Barron’s added its own possible candidates for the Berkshire Hathaway mystery stock. Besides Morgan Stanley, it identified BlackRock (NYSE: BLK ) or Chubb (NYSE: CB ). “The mystery company or companies probably are in the financial sector because the cost basis of Berkshire’s equity holdings in financial stocks has risen by about $5 billion in the past three quarters and declined for two other categories of stocks,” wrote Barron’s Andrew Bary.
Not the First Rodeo Regarding a Berkshire Hathaway Mystery Stock
Institutional stakeholders of U.S.-based securities reveal their positions in 13F disclosures. However, according to the SEC website, these investors have the option of requesting confidential treatment . That’s exactly what Berkshire did regarding its Q4 filing.
While interest has spiked regarding the Berkshire Hathaway mystery stock, this isn’t the first time the conglomerate has requested such treatment. In late 2020, Berkshire requested confidentiality when it was acquiring shares of Chevron (NYSE: CVX ) and Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ).
However, to Barron’s point, the “company makes use of confidential filings more than other big investors.” It then raises the question about the significance of the Berkshire Hathaway mystery stock in relation to the conglomerate’s strategy.
According to a research paper submitted to the Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis , entities may choose to keep their trades quiet because “confidential positions earn positive and significant abnormal returns over the post-filing confidential period.”
In other words, confidential investments tend to perform better relative to normal market expectations. Therefore, keeping the cards close to the chest may better protect proprietary investing strategies.
Why It Matters
It’s not out of the realm of possibility that Berkshire could request another quarter of confidential treatment. However, Barron’s states that such a circumstance would be unusual. Should the disclosure come later today, the conglomerate will likely amend its filings for Q3 and Q4 to include the much-discussed security.

2024-05-15,"Apple announces new accessibility features, including Eye Tracking, Music Haptics, and Vocal Shortcuts","Apple® today announced new accessibility features coming later this year, including Eye Tracking, a way for users with physical disabilities to control iPad® or iPhone® with their eyes. Additionally, Music Haptics will offer a new way for users who are deaf or hard of hearing to experience music using the Taptic Engine® in iPhone; Vocal Shortcuts will allow users to perform tasks by making a custom sound; Vehicle Motion Cues can help reduce motion sickness when using iPhone or iPad in a moving vehicle; and more accessibility features will come to visionOS™. These features combine the power of Apple hardware and software, harnessing Apple silicon, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to further Apple’s decades-long commitment to designing products for everyone.
“We believe deeply in the transformative power of innovation to enrich lives,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “That’s why for nearly 40 years, Apple has championed inclusive design by embedding accessibility at the core of our hardware and software. We’re continuously pushing the boundaries of technology, and these new features reflect our long-standing commitment to delivering the best possible experience to all of our users.”
“Each year, we break new ground when it comes to accessibility,” said Sarah Herrlinger, Apple’s senior director of Global Accessibility Policy and Initiatives. “These new features will make an impact in the lives of a wide range of users, providing new ways to communicate, control their devices, and move through the world.”
Eye Tracking Comes to iPad and iPhone
Powered by artificial intelligence, Eye Tracking gives users a built-in option for navigating iPad and iPhone with just their eyes. Designed for users with physical disabilities, Eye Tracking uses the front-facing camera to set up and calibrate in seconds, and with on-device machine learning, all data used to set up and control this feature is kept securely on device, and isn’t shared with Apple.
Eye Tracking works across iPadOS® and iOS apps, and doesn’t require additional hardware or accessories. With Eye Tracking, users can navigate through the elements of an app and use Dwell Control to activate each element, accessing additional functions such as physical buttons, swipes, and other gestures solely with their eyes.
Music Haptics Makes Songs More Accessible
Music Haptics is a new way for users who are deaf or hard of hearing to experience music on iPhone. With this accessibility feature turned on, the Taptic Engine in iPhone plays taps, textures, and refined vibrations to the audio of the music. Music Haptics works across millions of songs in the Apple Music® catalog, and will be available as an API for developers to make music more accessible in their apps.
New Features for a Wide Range of Speech
With Vocal Shortcuts, iPhone and iPad users can assign custom utterances that Siri® can understand to launch shortcuts and complete complex tasks. Listen for Atypical Speech, another new feature, gives users an option for enhancing speech recognition for a wider range of speech. Listen for Atypical Speech uses on-device machine learning to recognize user speech patterns. Designed for users with acquired or progressive conditions that affect speech, such as cerebral palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or stroke, these features provide a new level of customization and control, building on features introduced in iOS 17 for users who are nonspeaking or at risk of losing their ability to speak.
“Artificial intelligence has the potential to improve speech recognition for millions of people with atypical speech, so we are thrilled that Apple is bringing these new accessibility features to consumers,” said Mark Hasegawa-Johnson, the Speech Accessibility Project at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign’s principal investigator. “The Speech Accessibility Project was designed as a broad-based, community-supported effort to help companies and universities make speech recognition more robust and effective, and Apple is among the accessibility advocates who made the Speech Accessibility Project possible.”
Vehicle Motion Cues Can Help Reduce Motion Sickness
Vehicle Motion Cues is a new experience for iPhone and iPad that can help reduce motion sickness for passengers in moving vehicles. Research shows that motion sickness is commonly caused by a sensory conflict between what a person sees and what they feel, which can prevent some users from comfortably using iPhone or iPad while riding in a moving vehicle. With Vehicle Motion Cues, animated dots on the edges of the screen represent changes in vehicle motion to help reduce sensory conflict without interfering with the main content. Using sensors built into iPhone and iPad, Vehicle Motion Cues recognizes when a user is in a moving vehicle and responds accordingly. The feature can be set to show automatically on iPhone, or can be turned on and off in Control Center.
CarPlay Gets Voice Control, More Accessibility Updates
Accessibility features coming to CarPlay® include Voice Control, Color Filters, and Sound Recognition. With Voice Control, users can navigate CarPlay and control apps with just their voice. With Sound Recognition, drivers or passengers who are deaf or hard of hearing can turn on alerts to be notified of car horns and sirens. For users who are colorblind, Color Filters make the CarPlay interface visually easier to use, with additional visual accessibility features including Bold Text and Large Text.
Accessibility Features Coming to visionOS
This year, accessibility features coming to visionOS will include systemwide Live Captions to help everyone — including users who are deaf or hard of hearing — follow along with spoken dialogue in live conversations and in audio from apps. With Live Captions for FaceTime® in visionOS, more users can easily enjoy the unique experience of connecting and collaborating using their Persona. Apple Vision Pro™ will add the capability to move captions using the window bar during Apple Immersive Video, as well as support for additional Made for iPhone hearing devices and cochlear hearing processors. Updates for vision accessibility will include the addition of Reduce Transparency, Smart Invert, and Dim Flashing Lights for users who have low vision, or those who want to avoid bright lights and frequent flashing.
These features join the dozens of accessibility features already available in Apple Vision Pro, which offers a flexible input system and an intuitive interface designed with a wide range of users in mind. Features such as VoiceOver, Zoom, and Color Filters can also provide users who are blind or have low vision access to spatial computing, while features such as Guided Access can support users with cognitive disabilities. Users can control Vision Pro with any combination of their eyes, hands, or voice, with accessibility features including Switch Control, Sound Actions, and Dwell Control that can also help those with physical disabilities.
“Apple Vision Pro is without a doubt the most accessible technology I’ve ever used,” said Ryan Hudson-Peralta, a Detroit-based product designer, accessibility consultant, and cofounder of Equal Accessibility LLC. “As someone born without hands and unable to walk, I know the world was not designed with me in mind, so it’s been incredible to see that visionOS just works. It’s a testament to the power and importance of accessible and inclusive design.”
Additional Updates
For users who are blind or have low vision, VoiceOver will include new voices, a flexible Voice Rotor, custom volume control, and the ability to customize VoiceOver keyboard shortcuts on Mac®.
Magnifier will offer a new Reader Mode and the option to easily launch Detection Mode with the Action button.
Braille users will get a new way to start and stay in Braille Screen Input for faster control and text editing; Japanese language availability for Braille Screen Input; support for multi-line braille with Dot Pad ; and the option to choose different input and output tables.
For users with low vision, Hover Typing shows larger text when typing in a text field, and in a user’s preferred font and color.
For users at risk of losing their ability to speak, Personal Voice will be available in Mandarin Chinese. Users who have difficulty pronouncing or reading full sentences will be able to create a Personal Voice using shortened phrases.
For users who are nonspeaking, Live Speech will include categories and simultaneous compatibility with Live Captions .
For users with physical disabilities, Virtual Trackpad for AssistiveTouch® allows users to control their device using a small region of the screen as a resizable trackpad.
Switch Control will include the option to use the cameras in iPhone and iPad to recognize finger-tap gestures as switches.
Voice Control will offer support for custom vocabularies and complex words.

This will be a future-defining event for Apple and its shareholders, who expect major announcements, specifically as it relates to GenAI.
I'm worried this will be a sell-the-news event, as it's hard to imagine how Apple can top extremely high expectations set by its management and the media.
Questions about Apple's long-term growth prospects will remain even if it's able to fuel a near-term iPhone replacement cycle.
Apple remains a top quality company in my view, but at the current valuation, the risk/reward equation is unfavorable.
Apple ( AAPL ) shares are flat year-to-date, trailing the rest of big tech by a significant margin. After a sharp recovery, the stock is now 6% below all-time highs.
The iPhone maker's underperformance is justified by lackluster growth since 2021, with five out of the last six quarters showing declining revenues on a year-over-year basis, as well as several quarters of declining net income....",5
2024-05-14,"3 Cryptos to Turn $100,000 Into $1 Million: Spring 2024","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
I am more confident investing in cryptos as an asset class for the long term. The reason is that the world of cryptocurrency has navigated the fear of being banned. Instead, the centralized and decentralized world seems to be working together, and the launch of the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETF underscores my view. Having said that, I would prefer to stick to top names if I had to select cryptos to buy for the long term.
The focus of this column is on three cryptos to buy and hold for five years (2028) for 10-bagger returns. Knowing the world of cryptos, 10x returns can come earlier. However, it’s good to be prudent in terms of expectations.
I would also like to add that I will not allocate more than 15% of my overall investment portfolio towards cryptos. However, even a 15% allocation will have a big impact, since we are talking about 10-bagger returns.
Let’s discuss three cryptos to buy and hold through 2028 for multibagger returns potential.
Bitcoin (BTC)

Bitcoin is the blue chip among cryptocurrencies. It’s like holding Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) or Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) in the crypto world. With crypto halving done, Bitcoin has trended higher by 42% for year-to-date and trades at $63,000. There are ample catalysts that will ensure that the uptrend sustains for Bitcoin.
In March, Cathie Wood opined that Bitcoin can trade as high as $3.8 million by 2030. That would imply an upside of nearly 6,000% from current levels. I must add here that Jack Dorsey recently opined that Bitcoin is likely to trade above $1 million by 2030.
Cathie’s estimates might be too optimistic, but if we look at a base-case scenario, 20x returns are likely by the end of the decade. There are two reasons for this view.
First, Bitcoin has a limited supply. As crypto adoption increases, the demand-supply scenario will be tight. That will translate into an uptrend. Further, long-term monetary policies will likely be expansionary. That is positive for risky asset classes like cryptocurrencies.
Ethereum (ETH)
Source: Thaninee Chuensomchit / Shutterstock.com
It’s worth noting that Bitcoin has trended higher by 40% year-to-date. During the same period, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) has rallied by 25%. The cryptocurrency continues to lag Bitcoin in terms of returns. However, I would not be surprised if Ethereum catches up in the coming years.
When the Bitcoin spot ETF was announced, the cryptocurrency surged higher. I expect a similar scenario for Ethereum with an ETF likely in the coming quarters. Analysts are talking about Ethereum trading at $15,000 by 2025. In my view, $10,000 levels are likely next year if the ETF is approved and the crypto bull market sustains.
I would also go back to Vitalik Buterin’s view in 2022 that Ethereum development is 55% complete after the merge. In the next few years, the cryptocurrency will likely surge as the roadmap progresses. Some key impending developments include increasing transaction speed and lowering cost.
BNB (BNB)
Source: Shutterstock
Binance is among the top 10 centralized crypto exchanges in the world. The BNB ( BNB-USD ) coin can be used to pay fees while trading on the Binance exchange. Further, users holding BNB coins above a certain threshold are given VIP tiers and additional fee discounts. Therefore, the first point to note is that the coin has a strong use case.
Another important point is that the bull market for cryptocurrencies is far from euphoric. It’s likely the best part of the current bull market will unfold in the next 12 to 18 months. That will translate into dozens of altcoins delivering multibagger returns.
The reason to mention this is to underscore the point that trading volumes will surge in the coming quarters. That will benefit some of the largest centralized exchanges like Binance. With a strong use case, the BNB coin is likely to trend higher.

2024-05-14,Stable Stocks: 3 Blue Chips to Buy for Longterm Profits,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Some investors favor blue-chip stocks that often provide the safest, most stable investments. Companies deemed blue-chip stocks have a long history of consistently excellent performance, profits and great dividends.
If you want to find the best blue-chip stocks to buy and make excellent, sure profits in the long term, look no further. These three stocks are giants within their respective industries. They’ve shown resilience to economic fluctuation and boast some of the most profitable and stable growth histories within stocks.
We’ll detail the services and products that make these stocks so profitable and the reasons their business models allow them to withstand the test of time.
Blackstone (BX)
Source: Isabelle OHara / Shutterstock.com
Blackstone (NYSE: BX ) is the most significant player in the competitive alternative asset management industry. It manages over $1 trillion in assets , including 12,500 real estate assets and private equity, in a diverse list of over 230 companies.
BX charges a fee to the owners of the assets it manages. And that fee increases along with the total assets that Blackstone manages. Growth and acquisitions mean more money for Blackstone. It has made exponential strides over the last 10 years but faced some economic headwinds due to rising interest rates.
Also, the company has increased its assets by billions in the last few years alone. In the first quarter of this year, Blackstone reported net accrued performance revenues of $6.1 billion , of which $1.2 billion will be distributed to shareholders. Real estate was the only section of Blackstone’s asset performance that took a hit, while the rest continued to improve.
Therefore, investors can feel confident about buying Blackstone at the reasonable valuation it holds right now. The stock is consistent and shows little to no sign of risk to impede the long-term profits that you can receive holding this stock.
Apple (AAPL)

As one of the most profitable companies, little needs to be said for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Mainstream consumers of almost all ages and backgrounds use Apple’s products and services, and the company continues to innovate and push the boundaries of technology.
While Apple has seen more volatility than other blue-chip stocks, it has powered through and consistently set new heights. AAPL has some of the most popular electronics, such as iPhones, iPads and watches. iPhones alone reached revenue of $231.3 billion in 2023.
In addition to its explosively popular electronics, Apple has seen wild success from its services so far this year. Streaming services like Apple TV and Apple Music have been consistently growing in popularity. In fact, they set a new record in revenue in Q2 of this year, reaching $90.8 billion.
Apple reported an EPS beat with a .66% increase in EPS, reaching quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.53. The company’s global popularity and projected continued growth make it an excellent blue chip stock to buy and hold for the long term.
Marsh & McLennan Companies (MMC)

Marsh & McLennan Companies (NYSE: MMC ) is an international advisory company for companies worldwide. The company specializes in insurance and acts as an advisor and broker to help clients obtain the necessary policies. The most significant benefit of Marsh & McLennan is its inherent ability to thrive in economic pitfalls.
Businesses always seek ways to protect their assets and avoid harmful liabilities in regular and unpredictable environments. Insurance will always be necessary, meaning Marsh & McLennan will have a consistent roster of clients for the foreseeable future. In addition to steady income, insurance provides the additional benefit of increased profitability during times of high inflation.
It’s no surprise that Marsh & McLennan prospered during last year’s inflation hike. The company reported $14 billion in revenue in 2023 and will likely continue its double-digit growth this year.
Marsh & McLennan is a model blue-chip stock with solid, consistent growth and profits that will surely create excellent long-term returns for investors.

2024-05-14,3 Retail Stocks Most at Risk of the New Cautious Consumer Trend,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
With consumer spending trends tightening and the average U.S. wage stagnating, investors should watch out for retail stocks at risk of a plunge. According to Deloitte Insights , 73% of consumers are still relatively concerned about the rising costs of goods and services. There is a general uneasiness around inflation, the cost of rent and the expensive nature of groceries and necessities.
Ultimately, this has driven consumers to reconsider what they spend their money on, which will undoubtedly impact the retail companies that sell non-essential items to the average person. Furthermore, this trend could also impact retailers who rely on a premium shopping experience to attract customers. In these cases, the retailer may upcharge on necessities to improve aesthetics and overall offerings. Thus, investors should keep an eye on the companies that no longer provide competitive value to average consumers.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com
Recent buybacks helped Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock out of its most recent slump, but consumer reactions to its new iPad commercial could give clues about broader attitudes towards the company’s products. The ad shows a collection of instruments, machines, cameras and other things that creatives hold dear being crushed by a massive hydraulic press. Though the ad is undoubtedly creative, it’s genuinely uncomfortable to watch and received an unending wave of negative reactions on social media.
So what does this mean for Apple? Well, consumer backlash against an ad won’t do much. But it does show that people care less about the product and more about the message from a company. The message Apple used to deliver was one of unending innovation, with each product generation being so much better than the last that you just had to upgrade or miss out.
Today, there’s little difference between Apple devices from year to year, which resulted in an 11% drop in Mac sales and a 15% drop in iPad sales last year. Time will tell if Apple will regain its sales momentum.
Best Buy (BBY)
Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com
Once renowned for its extensive selection of electronics and great customer service, Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ) has struggled with many of its underperforming store locations. In fiscal year 2024, which ended Jan. 31, 2024, the company closed 24 of its locations while still managing to keep revenue growing thanks to the holiday shopping season. Now in its fiscal year 2025, the company expects to close another 10-15 locations. The reason? A lack of a compelling shopping experience.
Why would consumers, who are already hunting for the best deals, choose to shop at Best Buy? After all, with how competitive the online retail market has become, a traditional warehouse model like the kind Best Buy offers simply isn’t convenient. There are still some advantages to being able to go and see a device in person before buying it, but even Best Buy knows it needs to adapt.
Now the company is pivoting towards a more modern and streamlined shopping experience while planning to discontinue many of its less profitable offerings. Yet, Best Buy could still be one of the retail stocks at risk until it finds its edge again.
Target (TGT)
Source: jejim / Shutterstock.com
Often considered the more premium alternative to larger supermarkets, Target’s (NYSE: TGT ) one-stop-shop model used to be incredibly competitive. Many shoppers swore by the company’s in-house brands while still having a vast array of brand-name products to choose from on its shelves. Furthermore, Target stores were known for being cleaner, safer and overall more attractive to shoppers of a higher socioeconomic standing.
However, due to rising retail theft in major U.S. urban centers such as New York, San Franciso, Seattle and Portland, the company had to shutter nine of its locations last year in October. This concerning trend is a result of the district attorneys within those cities choosing not to prosecute theft, emboldening criminals to steal and resell Target’s merchandise online.
Even worse for Target, consumers may choose to shop at its rivals like Walmart (NYSE: WMT ) instead for more competitive prices in a time where the shopping experience matters less than saving money. This may ultimately place TGT among retail stocks at risk of a loss.

2024-05-14,Apple Addiction: 3 Fund Managers Doubling Down on AAPL Stock,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Despite the weakness in Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone sales in China, there are still funds buying Apple stock.
Almost a year ago, I wrote about fund managers still buying Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) stock despite being up 25% on its Q1 2024 results. Its shares have more than doubled over the past 52 weeks.
Can Apple do the same?
I’m not sure that is in the cards, but there is evidence that its share price is undervalued at the moment, prompting fund managers to buy AAPL stock, which is down more than 1% year-to-date.
Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani believes Apple is a Buy. The analyst rates it Outperform with a $220 target price, 20% higher than where it’s currently trading.
“Investors should not underestimate the ability of the iPhone to continue to deliver growth over the next five years,” Barron’s reported the analyst’s comments from a May 9 note to clients.
Here are three fund managers who feel the same.
Norges Bank
Source: shutterstock.com/NeoLeo
Norges Bank is Norway’s central bank , fulfilling a role similar to that of the U.S. Federal Reserve. However, it is different because it also manages the country’s Government Pension Fund Global on behalf of Norway’s Ministry of Finance. The fund’s current market value is 17.71 trillion Swedish kroner ($1.63 trillion).
WhaleWisdom.com data suggests that the fund made a new position in the fourth quarter of 2023, adding 176.1 million shares of Apple stock valued at $33.91 billion as of Dec. 31, 2023.
However, that isn’t entirely accurate.
Looking back on the central bank’s 13F-HR forms, it has owned Apple for years. At the end of 2022, it owned 167.37 million shares . Then, for the next few quarters, its 13F-HR forms were confidential to meet disclosure requirements under Norwegian law.
As discussed above, the latest 13F showed that it held 176.1 million shares of Apple stock, so I’m going to assume that it added approximately 8.73 million Apple shares in 2023, a 5.2% increase from 2022.
While Norges Bank isn’t one of Apple’s top owners, it is one of the 10 largest, in ninth position as of Dec. 31. Apple is the fund’s second-largest holding behind Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), whose shares were valued at $35.92 billion at the end of 2023.
Cerity Partners
Source: Shutterstock
One of the investment firms to add the most Apple shares in the final quarter of 2023 was a much smaller asset manager. Cerity Partners initiated a new position of 9.43 million shares of Apple, accounting for 3.59% of its $30.44 billion in assets listed on its 13F.
Like Norges Bank, Apple is the asset manager’s second-largest holding, behind only the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA: VOO ). With a 4.01% weighting and a market value of $1.22 billion, Apple’s valuation at the end of December was about $108 million higher than its Apple shareholdings valuation.
In the case of Cerity, the position is new because it converted debt securities valued at approximately $702 million at the end of Q3 2023 in the fourth quarter of 2023.
The New York City hedge fund and financial advisor has 16,424 clients and nearly $65 billion in assets under management.
Interestingly, at the end of 2022, it held 4.82 million shares of Apple stock, so clearly, Cerity’s opinion of Apple stock has gotten even stronger over the past 16 months.
SpiderRock Advisors
Source: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.com
SpiderRock Advisors is the smallest of three investment managers with a Q4 2023 13F of $4.02 billion and assets under management of $4.85 billion from 335 clients. Based in Chicago, Apple is its largest holding, accounting for 13.52% of its $4 billion in 13F assets.
After reviewing the nuances of the Cerity Partners example from above, I checked SpiderRock’s 13Fs to confirm that it is a new position.
At the end of Q3 2024, it held put options for 629,900 shares . It did not own any Apple shares outright. At the end of Q4 2023, it had 3.13 million shares and put options for another 652,600 shares, an increase of 22,700 from the previous quarter.
However, it’s not an entirely new position in that it’s never held an interest in Apple stock. At the end of Q4 2022 , it had call options for 600 shares and put options for 453,900. A year before that, it held put options for 127,800 shares as of Dec. 31, 2021.
The above situation illustrates why it’s essential to look at the actual 13Fs and not just data from third-party providers such as WhaleWisdom.com. WhaleWisdom.com is an excellent resource, but if you don’t subscribe to its paid service, you’ll not get the full picture.

2024-05-14,Metaverse Moguls: 3 Stocks Poised to Dominate the Virtual Realm,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The Metaverse was once thought to be the next iteration of the internet. However, after billions of dollars of investments from tech companies, the Metaverse has yet to live to its full potential. Still, the largest tech companies in the world continue to invest in the Metaverse in hardware and software. It’s surprising how advanced the technology has become in just a few short years. As investors, the best investments are made in the early, undercover ideas that others may not fully understand. Here are three Metaverse stocks to buy for those interested in the opportunity and possibility of the Metaverse.
Meta Platforms (META)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) is a no-brainer as one of the top Metaverse stocks to buy after changing its name from Facebook to Meta in 2021. As of May 2024, Meta is the seventh-largest company in the world by market cap and one of only seven companies worth more than $1 trillion. How does Wall Street feel about Meta? In April, 53 of 62 analyst recommendations were a Buy or Strong Buy rating. Additionally, its average price target of $516.13 is nearly $40 higher than its current price of $476.20.
Since 2020, the Reality Labs department at Meta has lost over $45 billion. While CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that spending will decline on the Metaverse, Reality Labs will continue to operate. Products like the Oculus AR/VR goggles and brand new Rayban Meta Smart Glasses have demonstrated their commitment to the Metaverse. Meta also sees an opportunity to expand to enterprise solutions and collaboration tools.
After gaining 37.5% in 2024, Meta’s stock remains cheap on a price multiple basis. Shares trade at just 8.8x sales and 24.1x forward earnings while maintaining an impressive 32% revenue CAGR over the past ten years. Even beyond its Metaverse potential, Meta is a company that is firing on all cylinders and shareholders can count on being richly rewarded.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is a name that needs no introduction. It is the second-largest company in the world, next to Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). Of the 38 analyst recommendations received in May, the stock has 32 Buy or Strong Buy ratings. The average analyst price target of $202.36 also represents a strong 10% upside from the current price.
With the launch of its VisionPro Headset earlier this year, Apple jumped headfirst into AR/VR. VisionPro only adds to Apple’s strong hardware base, with more than 2.2 billion active devices worldwide as of February 2024. With the headset on, users can operate most applications from the Apple ecosystem in real-time virtual reality. From messaging to streaming videos to Facetiming friends worldwide, VisionPro gives a small taste of Apple’s long-term plans in the Metaverse.
Apple stock is trading at a relatively reasonable 7.4x sales and 27.9x forward earnings. After dipping its toe into the Metaverse and recently committing to building data center chips for AI, investors should look to Apple as a company that may be on the cusp of its next big growth story.
Autodesk (ADSK)
Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com
Autodesk (NASDAQ: ADSK ) is a tech company that builds software platforms for architecture and design. Analysts remain bullish on the stock despite ADSK returning a loss of about 7.0% this year. As a testament to this, the average analyst price target of $287 represents about 30% upside from its current price and the street-high price target of $320 is nearly 50% higher.
This company utilizes the Metaverse as a way for users to design and model buildings in virtual reality. Using the Metaverse, Autodesk allows for greater remote collaboration and a more precise simulation. In this way, Autodesk is one company that uses Metaverse to improve efficiencies and productivity for the users of its software platforms.
Due to its underperformance this year, Autodesk is trading at more attractive and depressed multiples. With shares trading at just 8.5x sales , its P/S ratio is nearly the lowest it has ever been in the past five years. While Autodesk doesn’t get the coverage that Meta and Apple get, you can bet on it as a well-run software company that will only continue maintaining its 16% five-year revenue CAGR.

2024-05-14,Stick a Fork in It and Run! Intel Stock Is Done.,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) was a darling of the chipmaking market many years ago. Then, it was a laughingstock in 2022, and then a darling again in 2023. Now, Intel is a troubled business again in 2024. Honestly, who really needs to invest in a nauseating roller-coaster play like Intel stock?
We’re giving the stock a “D” grade and telling you right now that it’s perfectly fine to get off that roller coaster. Just look at the progress of the Intel share price from May 2023 to May 2024.
That’s right — there was no progress during that time frame. Intel stock was “dead money,” and we didn’t identify any compelling reasons to invest your hard-earned capital in Intel now.
U.S. Blocks Intel’s Chip Sales to Huawei
As multiple reporters have stated, the U.S. government has banned Intel from exporting to China-based technology-product manufacturer Huawei Technologies . The objective is for the U.S. to curb China’s tech-industry power.
That’s bad news for Intel, a major supplier of chips to Huawei. Intel has acknowledged that Huawei export ban would put pressure on the chipmaker’s revenue.
This is the worst possible timing for Intel. The company is trying to reinvent itself as a foundry chipmaker. By that, we mean Intel seeks to manufacture its own chips and sell them to other companies.
Considering this adverse development, Daniel Newman, CEO of The Futurum Group, offered a stark warning about Intel stock.
“There’s no reason to own it in the short-term, since short-term investors have to deal with capex outlays, issues with the foundry business, and a lack of meaningful data-center growth,” Newman cautioned.
Apple Will Be a Tough Competitor to Intel
In case there wasn’t enough negative news about Intel, here’s another distressing tidbit. As you may be aware, artificial intelligence personal computer chips are an important revenue source for Intel. Now, Intel will have a major competitor in this area.
Actually, “competitor” might not be the right word; “obliterator” may be more appropriate. Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) new M4 chip is supposedly so powerful that it could make the competitors’ AI-PC chips instantly obsolete.
Per Yahoo! Finance , Apple claims that the M4 chip’s neural engine is the “company’s fastest yet.” The M4 is apparently “more powerful than any neural processing unit available on today’s AI PCs.”
Consider the implications for Intel in 2024. Apple is a massive, capital-rich juggernaut that can continue to develop its chips. Intel now has to fend off the threat posed by Apple’s ultrapowerful M4 chip. To borrow some old song lyrics, we “see a bad moon rising” for Intel.
Intel Stock: Say ‘No, Thanks’ to the Roller Coaster
Intel’s shareholders were either brilliant or just luck in 2023. Hopefully, they had the foresight to take profits while those profits were available.
Today, we’ve just given you some compelling reasons to either be neutral or bearish on Intel in 2024. All in all, we’ll continue to monitor the company for further developments, but we’re assigning Intel stock a “D” grade and aren’t currently recommending it.

2024-05-14,Alphabet Stock Outlook: Pounce on GOOG if There's an Open AI-Driven Sell-Off,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ,NASDAQ: GOOGL ) has been flying high, but this latest Alphabet stock rally is losing momentum amid fears of a sell-off. Investors worry the company’s advertising moat is diminishing.
The fear, uncertainty, and doubt may scare off skittish investors, but a sell-off could benefit those with a long-term perspective.
Alphabet Stock and the Recent OpenAI News
Over the past year, Alphabet has made significant progress in demonstrating to the market that it is not an “also ran” when it comes to generative AI technology. This AI progress played a role in the company’s strong fiscal performance during the preceding quarter .
However, while increased confidence in Alphabet’s AI catalyst played a role in Alphabet stock continuing to rally after its April 25 quarterly earnings release, as mentioned above, this rally could be fast giving way to a pullback. It all has to do with two recent news items regarding AI technology rising star OpenAI .
First, news that Alphabet lost out to OpenAI for a potentially game-changing mobile AI integration deal with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Second, rumors regarding OpenAI’s plans to unveil a new AI-powered search engine .
OpenAI partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), which integrated AI into its Bing search engine. Now OpenAI plans to supplant Google in search.
Rumors have had a moderate impact on GOOG’s price and could continue to affect shares. Or worse, all of a sudden have a significant impact.
An Overreaction Could Prove Advantageous
Yes, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has denied that an unveiling or launch of a search product from the company is imminent. Yet while this may be technically true, there are enough anecdotes out there to suggest that a major update on this could arrive soon .
Now, I’m not saying that if OpenAI unveils an AI search product in the months ahead, this will cause Alphabet stock to sink toward its 52-week low. It may, however, drive a moderate pullback. For instance, a move back down to between $125 and $150 per share.
This would have course be a frustrating turn of events, especially if you bought into GOOG right after the earnings release. However, if you’re a long-term GOOG shareholder, or if you’ve been sitting on the sidelines, this could be a great opportunity.
Why? Shares are more than reasonably priced at 22.5 times forward earnings. Even a moderate pullback would push shares down to a valuation not too far, if not in, value stock territory. Better yet, such an overreaction could prove short-lived.
In fact, all it may take is another quarter of strong growth to quell “end of Google” fears, and to send shares surging higher once again.
The Verdict: Pounce on Any Weakness That Arises
OpenAI may be an AI first-mover, but it hasn’t been unstoppable in market disruption. After all, a Chat GPT-infused Bing may have beaten Google to the punch, the impact of this on market share has been far less than originally expected . I wouldn’t be writing the obituary for Google search just yet.
You don’t have to wait for the OpenAI search rumors to prove true or not to enter a position. As we have argued recently, even at current prices, it’s well worthwhile to enter a buy-and-hold position .
However, if Sam Altman is giving evasive answers, and OpenAI is gearing up for an AI search launch, don’t dread it, look forward to it. It may just well prove to be the next great opportunity to increase exposure to Alphabet stock on the cheap.
Alphabet stock earns an A rating in Portfolio Grader.

2024-05-14,"If You'd Invested $10,000 in Apple Stock 5 Years Ago, Here's How Much You'd Have Today","Over the past five years, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has risen by 277%, adjusted for a 2020 stock split. But it's also important to note that Apple pays a modest dividend , so assuming reinvestment of all the dividends you received over the past five years, Apple's five-year total return through May 13 was 291%.
So, if you had invested $10,000 in Apple stock five years ago, and had reinvested your dividends along the way, your investment would have grown to about $39,100.
To put it mildly, this is extraordinary performance. A 291% total return over a five-year period translates to 31% annualized total returns. Meanwhile, the long-term average of the S&P 500 is about 10%.",5
2024-05-14,Apple Stock Alert: Warning! AAPL's Problems Are Getting Worse.,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Apple’s (NASDQ: AAPL ) first-quarter financial results contained some very discouraging signs, making the stock a sell in the near-term. Up until now, it has been easy to defend Apple stock.
Sales of the company’s electronic devices — its iPhones and MacBooks — had been slowing, but the services side of the business — streaming and Apple Pay — more than made up for the shortfall. However, problems are compounding. Apple can’t maintain the growth it has enjoyed since the iPhone was introduced in 2007.
Troubling Numbers
Apple’s Q1 print was poor. So bad that the company distracted from the dismal numbers by announcing it will buyback $110 billion of its own stock.
It’s the largest share repurchase in corporate history. The move worked. Media headlines focused on the stock buyback and not the financial results. Investors have bid the stock up nearly 10% since the earnings were announced.
The new share repurchases represent a 22% increase over last year’s $90 billion authorization. Apple also said it would pay a 25 cent dividend going forward, a one cent increase. While investors cheered the stock buyback program and dividend hike, they overlooked some troubling numbers .
Overall sales in Q1 declined 4% from a year earlier, while iPhone sales, which account for half Apple’s revenue, fell 10% year over year during the quarter.
The poor results weren’t confined to the iPhone. The “other products” segment that includes the Apple Watch and AirPod headphones also saw sales decline 10%.
No indication was given on how sales are performing for the Vision Pro virtual reality headset that went on sale at the start of this year and retails for $3,500. Management declined to provide any forward guidance for the current second quarter.
Pulling Out All The Stops
Apple is doing all it can to right the ship and get its sales and stock growing again. In addition to launching the Vision Pro headset, Apple has unveiled new versions of its iPad Air and iPad Pro tablets and teased a big artificial intelligence announcement at its upcoming June developer conference.
This as CEO Tim Cook embarks on a global tour, visiting China, India and crisscrossing the U.S.
There have also been media reports that Apple is developing microchips to run AI software in data centers and that the company is negotiating with Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG /NASDAQ: GOOGL ) to add that company’s Gemini AI technology to future versions of the iPhone.
A major revamp of the iPhone, possibly to include AI, certainly seems to be needed.
Some analysts and investors are taking the news reports as signs that Apple is quickly recovering. But most of what’s been reported amounts to little more than rumors at this point. Apple needs to get new and exciting products into the hands of consumers.
It’s current product lineup has grown stale. Apple also faces growing competition, especially in markets like China where companies such as Huawei have supplanted it .
Sell AAPL Stock
AAPL stock is down 1% on the year and has only risen 6% in the last 12 months. The company has trailed the bull market of the past year. It has also underperformed vis-à-vis most other megacap technology stocks .
At the recent Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A /NYSE: BRK:B ) annual meeting, it was revealed that Warren Buffett trimmed his stake in Apple by 13%. This came as a shock to many as Buffett has, until now, been one of Apple’s biggest fans and shareholders. Apple accounts for 40% of Berkshire Hathaway’s equity portfolio, its largest holding.
Clearly, Buffett has some concerns about Apple and what is happening with the company right now. Investors should share Buffett’s concern. Apple stock is not a buy.

2024-05-13,Now Even Apple Wants to Make Data Center Chips! Which Are the 3 Best Chipmaker Stocks to Buy?,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is best known for its consumer electronic products that develop a cult-like following. In fact, the tech stock is a formidable chipmaker. The very first in-house chip appeared in the iPhone 4 way back in 2010. Yet today, all Apple computers run on their own processors.
Apple’s chips are for its own consumption though. They don’t sell them to others. And because it relies upon its own designs, it is no longer beholden to other chipmakers for supply. Now Apple isn’t a foundry. It doesn’t physically make its own processors. As so many others do, it turns that function over to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM ).
But currently, Apple is looking to expand. A recent report in The Wall Street Journal said the tech giant was developing its own chips that are designed to run artificial intelligence ( AI ) software in data center servers.
Apple Chips in Data Centers are codenamed ACDC. These processors will target AI inference rather than AI training. The difference between them is with training, the processors develop and refine AI algorithms while inference, take already-trained AI algorithms to use real-world data.
Apple isn’t alone. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) are developing custom inference chips to minimize reliance on third-party chipmakers. But with the field growing more crowded which are the best chipmaker stocks to buy? The three companies below easily make the cut.
Nvidia (NVDA)
Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com
There is no question Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) has to top the list. Its graphics processing units ( GPU ) dominate right now with a 98% share of the data center market , according to Wells Fargo. Although that is expected to drop to between 94% and 96% as rivals bring their own processors to market, Nvidia will still be the industry leader.
Nvidia’s GPUs target the training side of the equation. Its original Tesla and Ampere GPUs were designed to tackle the vast computational challenges AI presented. Its next-generation Hopper GPUs took it to the next level. Those had an ability to deliver sixfold more performance than the Ampere chips. The H100 chips are still seen as the foundational base that other chipmakers aspire to teach AI models. Now the latest iteration is the GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip which triples the bandwidth the H100 offered.
But, it is much more expensive, so adoption may not be as quick. For unparalleled power, hyperscalers may choose the GH200. Yet it opens up a wedge for competitors to offer lower cost chips that can more than get the job done. Still, Nvidia remains the premiere AI chipmaker stock to buy.
Arm Holdings (ARM)
Source: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com
British chip stock Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM ) is not exactly a chipmaker. Rather it develops a chip architecture and a set of instructions that it licenses to customers. Apple’s chips are all ARM processors. The two signed an agreement last year that is extends through 2040 and beyond .
Apple and Arm’s other clients include Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). These companies pay royalties to Arm Holdings on each unit shipped.
ARM’s low power needs have made the chips exceptionally popular with mobile handset manufacturers. Also, it made them in demand for data centers, where energy consumption is increasingly a concern . The large language model chips from Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon all run on Arm’s newest V9 technology. While the primary functions of data centers are performed by GPUs, Arm Holdings chips will run alongside them. So, they will benefit from the growth AI is creating in data center demand.
Indeed, because of Nvidia’s data cen ter dominance, you could see ARM become an integral part of data center architecture. Nvidia’s latest, most advanced chip Grace Blackwell Superchip integrates the chipmaker’s GPUs with Arm Holding’s central processing units ( CPUs ). ARM Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) Rene Haas told analysts , “I think now with Nvidia’s most recent announcement, Grace Blackwell, you are going to see an acceleration of ARM of the data center in these AI applications.”
Since Arm Holdings works, well, arm-in-arm with these chipmakers it will be a top stock to buy .
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)
Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com
If Nvidia and other chipmakers are going to benefit from the rise of AI in data centers, then it’s clear the manufacturer they turn to to actually make the chips must be included as well. As their business grows, so will Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.
As noted above, Apple isn’t making its own chips. TSM makes them. The same is true for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO ) and Qualcomm . TSM is the world’s largest chip foundry pureplay. Because of “insatiable” demand for AI chips, the company forecast sales will grow by low- to mid-20% rates this year with AI accounting for low-teen percentages of revenue.
Supply chain issues and capacity constraints have actually held the chipmaker back over the past few years. However, it is building new factories to meet demand. But a second manufacturing plant in Arizona has been put on hold as rising costs and lack of skilled labor dent progress.
Still, TSM just reported a 60% year-over-year ( YOY ) surge in April sales that also grew 20% jump from March, indicating business is still strong. That makes Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing one of the best chipmaker stocks to buy.

An Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Store strike is coming to Towson, Maryland as members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Coalition of Organized Retail Employees (IAM CORE) voted in favor of the strike .
This strike comes after the union employees have negotiated with Apple for over a year. The IAM CORE members decided on the strike due to the “unsatisfactory outcomes” of these negotiations.
Here’s what the IAM CORE Negotiating Committee said about the Apple Store strike:
“The passage of the strike sanction vote highlights IAM CORE’s unwavering commitment to advocating for the rights and well-being of workers in the face of challenges. As discussions with Apple management continue, we remain committed to securing tangible improvements that benefit all employees.”
Timing of the Apple Store Strike
It’s still not been decided when this Apple Store strike will take place. What is worth noting is that the Towson, Maryland location was the first Apple Store to unionize . Other stores have attempted to do so, but with less success.
This has resulted in conflict between Apple and some of its retail employees. That includes allegations that the tech giant has taken part in union-busting tactics to keep its workers from unionizing.

My previous bullish upgrade on QQQ in early October emphasized that QQQ seemed ""well-primed to restart the next leg in its uptrend continuation (valid since March 2023)."" As a result, bearish investors who failed to anticipate the market's astute positioning and bullish price action likely missed capitalizing on QQQ's significant surge....",6

2024-05-13,Apple Music celebrates the greatest records ever made with the launch of inaugural 100 Best Albums list,"A 10-day countdown kicks off today with the reveal of albums 100-91, featuring works from Solange; Tyler, The Creator; George Michael; and more
Discover, share, and follow along as Apple Music journeys through the albums that shaped, inspired, and fundamentally changed music
Apple Music® today announced the release of its 100 Best Albums of all time, a celebratory list of the greatest records ever made, crafted by Apple Music’s team of experts alongside a select group of artists, including Maren Morris, Pharrell Williams, J Balvin, Charli XCX, Mark Hoppus, Honey Dijon, and Nia Archives, as well as songwriters, producers, and industry professionals. The list is an editorial statement — fully independent of any streaming numbers on Apple Music, a love letter to the records that have shaped the world we live and listen in.
This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240513024769/en/
(Graphic: Apple Inc.)
Apple Music is bringing its 100 Best Albums to life with a countdown celebration beginning today, revealing 10 albums each day for the next 10 days, along with a brand-new 100 Best microsite, new and exclusive content, dedicated Apple Music radio episodes, and so much more. The countdown will culminate on the final day with the reveal of Apple Music’s top 10 albums of all time during a broadcast radio special.
“100 Best brings together all the things that make Apple Music the ultimate service for music lovers — human curation at its peak, an appreciation for the art of storytelling, and unparalleled knowledge of music and an even deeper love for it,” said Rachel Newman, Apple Music’s senior director of content and editorial. “We have been working on this for a very long time, and it’s something we are all incredibly proud of and excited to share with the world.”
“Putting this list together was a true labor of love, both in that it was incredibly difficult to do and in that we are all so passionate about it,” said Zane Lowe, Apple Music’s global creative director and lead anchor for Apple Music 1. “We were tasked with selecting the 100 best — that’s practically mission impossible. But as music fans, it was also amazing to really take a minute and sit and think about the music and albums and artists that we love so much in this context. If this list sparks more debate among fans outside of Apple Music and gets people talking passionately about the music they love, then we’ve done what we set out to do.”
The first 10 albums, revealed today, offer a glimpse into Apple Music’s unique approach with 100 Best. With seven of the 10 records hailing from the 21st century, two from the 90s, only one from the 70s, and various genres represented, the list spotlights contemporary artists like Tyler, The Creator; Robyn; Lorde; Travis Scott; Solange; Burial; and more who have helped define this century through their music and its influence on others.
100. Body Talk , Robyn
99. Hotel California, Eagles
98. ASTROWORLD, Travis Scott
97. Rage Against the Machine , Rage Against the Machine
96. Pure Heroine , Lorde
95 . Confessions , USHER
94. Untrue , Burial
93. A Seat at the Table , Solange
92. Flower Boy , Tyler, The Creator
91. Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1 , George Michael
“There are so many fun facts for our listeners to discover about these albums,” said Scott Plagenhoef, Apple Music’s global head of music programming. “For example, two of the records revealed today were promoted without the image of the artist, but for opposite reasons — Burial’s Untrue because the artist was still operating anonymously at the time, and George Michael’s Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1 because the artist was actually retreating from fame.”
Discover, Learn, and Share with Friends
To accompany the list, today Apple Music also revealed a dedicated microsite that will update every day of the countdown, making it easy for listeners to follow along. Available now at 100best.music.apple.com , the new 100 Best microsite spotlights in-depth analysis of each album, archival interviews, and more, and makes it easy for fans to share their favorite albums with friends and on their social channels.
Explore records 100-91 of Apple Music’s 100 Best Albums at 100best.music.apple.com .
Follow Along on Apple Music Radio
Fans will also be treated to a full 100 Best Albums Radio takeover on Apple Music Hits, broadcasting round-the-clock specials with Apple Music Radio hosts, daily specials at 9 a.m. PT (noon ET), plus exclusive content dropping every day on demand on Apple Music and Apple Podcasts.
The last 10 albums will be revealed on Wednesday, May 22, with a special roundtable discussion broadcasting globally on Apple Music that features guest artists Nile Rodgers and Maggie Rogers reflecting on the list alongside Apple Music’s own Zane Lowe and Ebro Darden. Lowe will also curate a special mashup-style DJ mix featuring songs from all 100 Best Albums.
Apple Music will keep the momentum going after the countdown ends with an additional week of 100 Best Albums Radio takeover on Apple Music Hits.
All 100 Best Album recipients will be given an award comprised of blasted anodized aluminum, sourced entirely from recycled Apple products, in a unique polished PVD gold. The design on the back of the award takes its cues from a vinyl LP record and is inscribed with the artist’s name, album’s title, and album’s year of release.

This is a notable announcement, as it marks the largest share buyback in U.S. corporate history.

2024-05-12,Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has delivered impressive gains to investors over the past five years, with shares of the tech giant rising close to 250% during this period and outpacing the S&P 500 index's gains of 77% by a big margin. The "" Magnificent Seven "" stock's robust rally can be attributed to the growing prominence of its high-margin services business, as well as a tremendous smartphone upgrade cycle triggered by the arrival of 5G smartphones.
However, Apple stock has lost its luster in 2024. It is down nearly 5%, and has underperformed the S&P 500 so far.
Berkshire Hathaway , led by celebrated investor Warren Buffett, has reduced its Apple stake by 13%. Moreover, analysts and investors are concerned that Apple has been late to capitalize on hot tech trends such as artificial intelligence (AI). Rivals such as Samsung are using AI to boost smartphone sales, while Apple's latest results indicate that the demand for iPhones is waning.",6

At the same time, while there's no denying the company's a juggernaut, there's also no denying its sheer size makes for tougher historical comparisons. There's only so much business one company can win! Any expectations for a fiscal slowdown from Apple during the three-month stretch ending in March would have been completely understandable.

2024-05-12,Warren Buffett Sold Apple and Paramount. Here's What He's Buying Instead.,"Warren Buffett hasn't found a lot to like in the stock market recently.

Last quarter, he sold off a big chunk of his Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) position and the entirety of his Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA) investment. All told, he sold nearly $20 billion worth of stocks from Berkshire's portfolio, and he bought less than $3 billion.
Buffett lamented investment opportunities for Berkshire are few and far between as the company grows bigger.

2024-05-12,AAPL Analysis: Why Apple Stock Dipped in Q2 and What's Ahead for Q3,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has yet to make its move in artificial intelligence and Apple stock is suffering for it. Shares were $165 before its most recent earnings announcement. Those numbers weren’t great . Sales and net income were both down slightly. A $110 billion buyback and a 25 cent/share dividend, the stock still rose, trading above $183.
It’s now down just $4/share from where it started the year, at $181/share. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), which recently passed it to become the world’s most valuable company, has extended its lead to $250 billion.
The great growth story of the 2010s is now just another value stock. Is this ever going to change?
Boring Into Apple Stock
Based on its May 7 iPad announcements the answer is no.
A thinner model, a better screen, and an electric pencil won’t move the needle. Reporters were reduced to commenting on CEO Tim Cook’s sneakers .
Apple has tried to evolve the iPad into a PC replacement, but it’s not working . Let’s not even start about the Vision Pro headset , now being pitched as a business tool .
Based on all this, why did I recently buy more Apple stock?
Waiting for WWDC
The reason will be announced June 10 at its Worldwide Developer Conference. That’s when we expect to hear Apple’s vision for AI.
There are already some hints. Project ACDC will put Apple AI chips in its data centers , with manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM ) already on the case.
The new chips will work on AI inference , answering questions from AI data rather than training the data itself.
This tells me Apple will focus on what’s now called “AI PCs,” performing intelligent tasks on clients rather than just servers. But rather than put AI on your desk, where the Mac is less relevant by the day, Apple will put AI into the iPhone.
Apple is all about interfaces. The key iPhone interfaces for AI right now look to be the Siri voice assistant and its messaging app. Expect the WWDC announcements to focus on software, like its Dynamic Island alert service and messaging.
Building AI into its entire product line, including the Vision Pro and Watch, will give Apple a holistic approach to AI. Most users today live in a mixed reality of PCs and Android phones, of FitBit watches and Xbox game machines. This may be a chance to make some converts.
Apple is talking to Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) about using its Gemini models in the cloud , but will build the interfaces and client software itself. Developers will then be let loose to build applications, and final hardware decisions will be seen in September at the iPhone 16 launch .
The Bottom Line
AI is upending the tech market like nothing since the Internet itself. But most analysts are still defining it based on the current paradigm of client, server, and cloud.
History says this is a mistake. Most leaders of the early Internet boom don’t exist today. It was of course the Cloud Czars who won the game, investing in the behind-the-scenes infrastructure needed to bring the 1990s’ promise to market.
That’s what all the Cloud Czar investors now fear, including those of us in Apple. Will AI be something you talk to? Will it be an application or an app like everything is now? Or will it be something immersive like the sci-fi of the 1980s ?
Truth is, we don’t know. This latest iteration of the Great Game is just starting, and not all of today’s industry leaders will make it through. But I’d rather bet on an expert in interfaces. I want one with plenty of cash to invest in figuring things out.
The time to get in on this opportunity is before it is realized, in the calm before the storm.

They went to ask questions and listen to answers from the legendary investor Warren Buffett while also paying tribute to the passing of his late partner, Charlie Munger. Buffett answered dozens of questions throughout the weekend, but it was perhaps a different news item that got the most headlines: He sold some of his Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) position.
The largest holding in his gargantuan stock portfolio, Apple is one of the businesses Buffett has praised for their high quality ever since greatly increasing his position a little over five years ago.

2024-05-11,The 3 Best Mutual Funds to Buy in May 2024,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
For investors looking to avoid the hassle and stress of picking individual stocks, the best mutual funds to buy remain a great option. These funds are comprised of pooled investments. A fund manager manages a mutual fund. These fund managers pick stocks and other investments, and determine their weighting within the fund. As they are actively managed, mutual funds tend to come with higher fees than more passive exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and self-managed portfolios.
While not for everyone, mutual funds can still prove to be a great choice for people who are not comfortable managing their own investments or who don’t want to spend the time needed to research and choose individual stocks. Some mutual funds track select stock market indexes such as the S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100, delivering nearly identical returns. There are also sector specific mutual funds and funds that focus on stocks in specific countries. Whatever a person’s interest, there’s sure to be a mutual fund to meet it.
Here are the three best mutual funds to buy in May 2024.
Vanguard Global Dividend Fund (VIC200)
The Vanguard Global Dividend Fund aims to provide an above-average level of investment income combined with long-term capital growth. The fund invested in high-paying dividend stocks of companies that are situated around the world in order to acheive this objective. Top holdings in the fund include stocks such as Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ) and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) in the United States, and TotalEnergies (NYSE: TTE ) and Novartis (NYSE: NVS ) situated in Europe.
Most of the stocks held in the Vanguard Global Dividend Fund have a dividend yield of 2.50% or greater, as well as a history of steadily increasing their payouts to shareholders. Vanguard manages it and this mutual fund comes with the Vanguard’s low fees. The current management fee associated with the fund is 0.31%, much less than most other actively managed mutual funds. The fund also pays its owners a quarterly dividend payment of 10 cents per unit held. Over the last 12 months, the fund has returned 16%.
iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
The iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA: IVV ) is run by asset manager BlackRock (NYSE: BLK ). This mutual fund tracks the performance of the S&P 500 index that is comprised of the 500 biggest publicly traded stocks in the U.S. by market capitalization. With the stock market currently in a bull run, the returns on this mutual fund have been excellent over the last year, rising 30%. Through five years, the fund has returned a decent 15% to investors.
As it tracks the S&P 500, the fund’s holdings are the mega-cap stocks that dominate the index, including Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ). Another attractive feature of the fund is its ultra low fees . Currently, BlackRock is charging a management fee of only 0.03%, which is rock bottom for a mutual fund. The iShares Core S&P 500 ETF also pays a quarterly dividend of $1.67 per unit held. For investors wanting a passive way to track the market, this is a great option.
Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX)

The Fidelity Contrafund (MUTF: FCNTX ) says that its objective is to invest in stocks of companies whose value is not fully recognized by the public. That said, the fund is heavily weighted to mega-cap tech . Top holdings include Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), among other well-known names. The composition of the fund appears to be working with it delivering a 36% return over the last 12 months.
Through five years, this mutual fund has returned 15% to investors . The expense ratio of 0.39% is not the lowest around. However, it is reasonable given the returns. There is no minimum investment amount required with the Fidelity Contrafund. However, if there’s one drawback with this fund it is that it does not pay a dividend. Still, the returns provided are very strong. Already in 2024, the Contrafund has delivered an 18% gain, which is better than the 10% ytd return of the benchmark S&P 500 index. If you are looking for the best mutual funds to buy, start here.

2024-05-10,The 3 Best Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy in May 2024,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Blue-chip stocks all have common denominators that set them apart from other, lesser stocks. They tend to be big, successful businesses that consumers and investors hold in high regard. Their financial statements are typically exemplary, indicating a level of consistency and stability that can allow shareholders to sleep soundly.
Look over the higher-end market caps of S&P 500 stocks and you’ll get a sense of the companies referred to as “blue-chip.” And what you’ll see that they are doing pretty well.
So far in 2024, blue chip stocks are outperforming both the broad-based index and the small-cap Russell 2000 index. For example, the Fidelity Blue Chip Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: FBCG ) is up over 16% year-to-date versus 9% for the S&P 500 and less than 2% for the small-cap index.
Finding the best blue-chip stocks to buy could be as easy as buying an exchange-traded fund ( ETF ). You get instant diversification at a relatively low cost. The Fidelity ETF has an expense ratio of just 0.48% and gives you access to over 300 blue-chip stocks.
But as stock pickers, I like to think we can do better. Below are three blue-chip stocks that are currently undervalued and should provide your portfolio with a fine balance of growth and income.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com
Shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) are down 5% in 2024 and until last week were sitting down more than 13%. Slowing sales in China, iPhone sales not lighting any fires and lagging development in artificial intelligence ( AI ) all conspired to depress the tech stock’s shares.
Yet it just held an iPad event that promises to reignite tablet sales. It has also been deemphasizing China while moving forcefully into India. Weaning itself away from China into more emergent markets could light that fire investors are looking for. An upcoming developers conference bodes well for AI becoming a force for the tech stock as well as the newest iteration of the iPhone. It promises to be feature-rich in AI.
And the reason Apple stock bounded higher last week was its announcement of a massive $110 billion share buyback plan . The tech company has so much cash sitting on its balance sheet it doesn’t know what to do with it. While stock repurchases artificially juice earnings per share, it can also signal management’s belief its own stock is undervalued.
Apple stock still trades at a premium of 28 times trailing earnings and 7x sales, but as the industry leader, it deserves its premium. With the catalysts outlined above, this blue-chip stock should soon be running higher again.
Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD)
Source: legacy1995 / Shutterstock.com
Although U.S. beer sales continue to slow, Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE: BUD ) remains an industry behemoth with a vast, global reach. Its recent earnings report indicates just how resilient it can be because of its far-flung operations.
Even as volumes continue falling in the U.S., due in part to A-B’s ill-advised decision to wade into the cultural wars, it showed its strength elsewhere. Volumes jumped by mid-single digits in Latin America core brands including Modelo and Pacifico, driving higher sales in Mexico. Corona did likewise in Brazil.
Constellation Brands (NYSE: STZ ) reaps all the benefits of the Modelo and Corona momentum in the U.S., as BUD sold the domestic rights to the brands to gain passage of its acquisition of the brewer. However, A-B retains them elsewhere in the world.
Anheuser-Busch reported a 5% increase in EBITDA to $4.9 billion, which was well above Wall Street’s estimates, while profit margins expanded 90 basis points.
As happened with Apple, shares of A-B jumped on the good news, easing some of the losses experienced in 2024. BUD stock is down less than 3% this year and at less than 2x sales, it is a historically low valuation. These are levels not seen in over a decade, except for during the pandemic. It marks an excellent time to buy this brewer’s blue-chip stock.
Toyota Motor (TM)
Source: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com
Toyota Motor (NYSE: TM ) is redefining the global auto industry with its big bet on hybrid vehicles. When the rest of the world was going all-in on all-electric cars, Toyota hedged its bets with hybrids . It believed consumers would want the reliability of a gas-powered engine to support an electric option. Its choice proved right.
While battery-electric vehicle ( BEV ) growth is dramatically slowing, hybrid sales are exploding. Toyota saw a dramatic 20% surge in first-quarter sales volume. It says EVs now account for 36.6% of its total sales.
Overall, though, the Japanese automaker’s vehicles are proving popular. That’s led to it having to use fewer incentives to get buyers to purchase, which improves Toyota’s bottom line. It is also building more factories in more countries, which will help it offset currency exchange rate effects now that the Japanese yen is so strong. Foreign exchange impacts were in part the reason Toyota guided toward a 20% decline in operating profits for the full year.
Toyota’s compact, fuel-efficient and forward-thinking vehicles have struck a chord with car buyers. Until battery technology catches up with buyer demand, Toyota is investing in new solid-state battery technology . This gives them the ability to purchase fossil-fuel-powered options is a smart strategy.
Toyota stock is up 24% year-to-date and 61% higher over the past year. Yet shares still trade at less than 10 times earnings and estimates and at a fraction of sales. While that’s in line with its U.S. counterparts, Toyota Motor sales exhibit robust strength. That makes it the blue-chip stock to buy.

2024-05-10,Earnings-Proof Tech Plays: 3 Stocks Set to Stay Hot Beyond Reporting Season,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Depending on where you look, there has been quite a tough crowd of investors to please this earnings season. Indeed, some companies still managed to blow away the numbers. But many firms ran into a road bump, with softer guidance causing investors to sell, even as the quarterly numbers came in just fine (or even ahead of expectations).
Indeed, there are unique applaud-worthy cases, like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), which sweetened its quarterly showing with a record-breaking share buyback on top of a better-than-expected quarter. Still, not every firm has pockets deep enough to buy back $110 billion worth of shares to top off an already sweet quarter.
Expecting higher guidance alongside big earnings and sales beats every quarter is unrealistic. Even the best companies can’t pull it off every earnings season. As expectations get too high, so do the potential downside risks of falling short going into earnings season.
Three earnings-resilient tech stocks will stay hot after their recent quarterly showings. Though no firm is immune from post-earnings plunges, I see each firm as having plenty of gas in the tank to keep going strong in the second half.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com
There was a lot to look at in the latest quarterly results for Apple. The big headline was, of course, the historic buyback. Beyond that, iPhone sales were looking rather sluggish, and China remained a notable weak spot (not as weak as expected, though) as economic headwinds and competition weighed.
That said, Apple CEO Tim Cook sounded optimistic about the Chinese market. Along with a Greater Chinese result (8% year-over-year fall in revenue) that was better than feared, things may just be looking up for Apple after many months’ worth of ominous headlines that shed light on the fact the iPhone is no longer the number-one smartphone seller in China.
Undoubtedly, the iPhone has been facing a great deal of competitive pressures in China of late. But just because the iPhone slipped from the top spot in the region does not mean it can’t be regained in the future. Perhaps Apple will succeed more with its iPhone 16 in China if it’s packed with innovations that set it apart.
Either way, I find expectations for the iPhone in China to still be quite muted and wouldn’t be surprised if the latest, surprisingly decent quarter helps AAPL stock sustain a return to its all-time highs again. Apple may not be “earnings-proof,” but it is worth holding through even the most jittery of earnings seasons. The latest numbers show us why it’s a bad idea to “play” the stock ahead of earnings.
American Express (AXP)
Source: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com
American Express (NYSE: AXP ) is another blue chip that really surprised to the upside when it reported this earnings season. Unlike Apple, AXP stock was going into its quarterly reveal after a pretty sizeable run that started when shares bottomed in October 2023. The rally is still on, and the latest results are well ahead of expectations. And I think it could have legs until the next round of American Express earnings.
For the latest (first) quarter, the credit card giant showed great discipline in controlling costs. Additionally, net revenue surged 11% to $15.8 billion, a very impressive showing for the $172 billion behemoth.
Once again, younger consumers helped drive the results. As the company enhances its focus on bringing on younger people aboard American Express, I’d not be surprised if the firm had a few more upside surprises up its sleeves.
American Express CEO Steve Squeri is a great boss. He’s serious about attracting younger clients, which is key to sustaining its growth. Younger people are spending a lot of money, and many will be enticed to swipe their American Express cards for great perks and points.
Eli Lilly (LLY)
Source: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi
Like American Express, Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY ) stock had quite a bit of multi-month momentum riding behind it ahead of earnings. Expectations were undoubtedly high, yet Eli Lilly still delivered an impressive showing.
For the first quarter, Lilly beat the bottom line while raising its full-year guidance for sales and adjusted earnings. The classic beat and raise helped LLY stock rise initially, though not by enough to break out of the $730-790 consolidation channel it had been stuck in since February 2024. Indeed, weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, were the show’s stars, helping Lilly move the needle higher (forgive the pun) on sales.
With a hefty valuation (59.2 times forward price-to-earnings) and lots of weight-loss drug hype still baked in, it’s unclear what it’ll take to help LLY stock break out past $800 per share. Perhaps more promising results from its phase-three diabetes drug could help investors rally behind the name.

2024-05-10,Monumental Funding Has Elon Musk AI Venture Primed For Takeoff,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Editor’s Note: This article was previously published under the title, “Learn How to Profit From Elon Musk’s $18 Billion AI Project” but has been updated to include the most recent information.
For years, one of the world’s richest men and arguably most influential tech visionary – Elon Musk – has mostly watched the AI Boom unfold from the sidelines.
That all changes now – quite literally as soon as next week.
That’s because just this past week, reports emerged suggesting that, any day now, Musk is set to secure up to $6 billion in funding for his new AI startup xAI.
Now, Musk founded xAI about a year ago. And to date, the company has done very little. Aside from launching its AI chatbot Grok – which many experts say matches up pound-for-pound with ChatGPT – things have been mostly quiet since xAI’s founding.
But this $6 billion funding round could change that in a dramatic way.
Of course, the thing about world-changing businesses is that they start with world-changing people. Those folks have revolutionary ideas. And when funded with billions of dollars, they turn those ideas into world-changing businesses.
After all, Apple ( AAPL ) only became what it is today thanks to Steve Jobs, who came up with the idea of the iPhone. Jobs then leveraged the enormous amount of money Apple was making off its computers to create the iPhone. And voila… Apple became a trillion-dollar company.
Similarly, Microsoft ( MSFT ) grew into a tech titan because of Bill Gates, who came up with the idea for Windows. Gates used the money Microsoft was making off its PCs to further develop Windows. And that allowed Microsoft to become a trillion-dollar company.
World-changing people with ample resources create world-changing businesses.
So… if you want to invest in world-changing businesses… start with the world-changing people gathering the resources necessary to bring their visions to life.
That is exactly the situation we have with Elon Musk and xAI today.
Invest in a World-Changer Like Elon Musk
We certainly believe that Elon Musk is a world-changer.
He co-founded PayPal ( PYPL ), the world’s largest digital payment platform, now worth nearly $70 billion…
And SpaceX , the world’s largest private space rocket firm, now worth about $180 billion.
He pioneered one of the world’s largest automakers in Tesla ( TSLA )…
And he’s also the man behind Neuralink , The Boring Company , and X .
Musk has influenced how we pay for things, what cars we drive, how we communicate online, how we see space…
I’d venture to say that he is one of the most influential business figures of the past 20 years.
A great example of world-changing.
And now this world-changing person has not only turned his focus to a new business venture at the heart of possibly the most transformative technology the world has ever seen. He’s also on the verge of reportedly acquiring $6 billion in funding to turn his AI vision into a reality.
Would you bet against him here – especially if he gets $6 billion next week to fund this operation?
I don’t think I would.
The Final Word
As we mentioned earlier, xAI has already launched its own impressive AI chatbot. And it did that with very little outside funding. Just imagine what Musk and company will be able to cook up with $6 billion in outside funding.
When all is said and done, xAI could be Elon Musk’s biggest venture yet – his signature mark on the world, if you will.
And right now, you have an opportunity to invest in xAI before this company takes off.
Now, it’s not a direct investment, per se. After all, xAI is barely a year old. It’s still a private startup, which means you can’t buy its stock anywhere.
But we have found a potentially huge “backdoor” investment into xAI. It’s a stock that you likely have never heard of before – but we think it could be the leading tech component supplier for this burgeoning AI titan.
If xAI does win the multi-trillion-dollar AI race… and Elon Musk does it again… then this stock could absolutely soar.
Get all the details about this potential future winner right now.

2024-05-10,The 3 Best Auto Stocks to Buy in May 2024,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The auto sector is entering an exciting and more lucrative era. That’s because automakers are starting to charge subscription fees for high-tech services. I believe that these companies will soon also start offering to track the well-being of various components within vehicles in exchange for fees. Which may transform them into the one of the best auto stocks investors want to buy. Of course, for the owners of electric vehicles, keeping informed about the welfare and needs of their EV’s batteries is extremely important. As a result, I’m sure that many owners will be willing to pay to stay on top of those matters.
Importantly, most consumers seem willing to pay monthly fees for services within their vehicles. But they often like to try out these services first. In July 2023, S&P polled roughly 4,500 consumers who had a free trial or a subscription for services within their vehicles. More than 80% of the respondents said they would consider purchasing subscription-based services in the future. For investors who want to profit from this trend, here are the three best auto stocks to buy.
General Motors (GM)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
Modern electric vehicles are much more computerized than their gas-powered counterparts. Lucid Motors (NASDAQ: LCID ) CEO Peter Rawlinson explained in 2021 that computing has become central to vehicles, especially EVs. As a result, it’s much easier to offer software-based services through EVs than gas-powered vehicles. Consequently, automakers that sell many EVs will be much better positioned to offer software subscriptions.
Among the veteran automakers, General Motors (NYSE: GM ) is one of the best positioned firms to become a top seller of EVs. Sales of the Cadillac Lyriq luxury SUV jumped 500% last quarter year-over-year to 5,800. The Chevrolet Bolt was a top-selling EV in the U.S before it was taken off the market. However, GM is slated to release a retooled version of the Bolt next year . Moreover, the automaker has begun selling electric versions of many of its most popular trucks and SUVs. I believe that these will become best sellers in the longer term. Boding well for the future, GM expects its North American EV business to enter the black in the second half of this year.
Finally, GM reported very strong first-quarter results, has a very low valuation, and is returning a great deal of cash to its shareholders.
Rivian (RIVN)
Source: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com
How can anyone not love a company that’s an integral partner of both Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL )?
It appears that EV maker Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN ) could be on the verge of achieving that huge milestone. As of last October, the start-up had provided Amazon with 10,000 of the delivery vans that the e-commerce giant has ordered . And tech website DigiTimes recently reported that Apple is considering forming a partnership with Rivian.
Such an alliance would certainly make sense for Apple. Obviously, the software behemoth is interested in selling products via EVs. And Rivian is one of the top American EV -oriented firms.
Meanwhile, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe did not deny that the automaker could partner with Apple. He even noted that his company has a history of partnerships. Given these points, I think there’s a very high chance of the two firms forming an alliance. Such a deal should prove to be very lucrative for Rivian.
VinFast (VFS)
Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com
VinFast (NASDAQ: VFS ) is a Vietnam-based EV startup that’s growing very rapidly and has a semi-secret weapon. Last quarter the company’s sales soared 270% YOY to $302.65 million. Meanwhile, its EV deliveries jumped 444% YOY to 9,689.
The automaker’s semi-secret weapon is its alliance with Israeli EV battery maker StoreDot . The company’s batteries will be utilized by VinFast’s commercially available vehicles starting next year.
Another EV maker, Polestar (NASDAQ: PSNY ), recently reported that a test they conducted showed that StorDot’s battery can add 200 miles worth of charge in just 10 minutes.

2024-05-09,Strategically Rebalance Your Dividend Portfolio In May 2024 For Optimal Risk-Reward Outcomes,"Rebalancing your dividend portfolio is essential for long-term investment success. Doing so helps to maintain a consistently reduced risk level, thereby improving the likelihood of positive investment outcomes.
In today's article, I will analyze the risk level of the current composition of The Dividend Income Accelerator Portfolio to determine the most effective ways of rebalancing it.

Investment Thesis
Last week I received a message from a Seeking Alpha reader asking me about my plans to rebalance The Dividend Income Accelerator Portfolio (the portfolio I am constructing here on Seeking Alpha). This question has contributed to my decision to write an article dedicated to the topic.
I considered this to be an excellent question since I am convinced that periodically rebalancing your dividend income portfolio is crucial for maintaining a continuously reduced risk level, resulting in elevated chances of positive investment results over the long term....",7

2024-05-09,3 Promising Robotaxi Stocks to Snap Up Before August 8,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
When Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) announced its August 8 robotaxi event, enthusiasm for autonomous driving got a shot in the arm. Indeed, Tesla stock also received a much-needed jolt as it looked to reverse gears after a nasty drawdown.
Earlier this year, excitement and hope in full-self-driving ( FSD ) technology and the concept of robotaxis faded a bit. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) reportedly pulled the plug on its Apple Car (or Project Titan) program. However, Tesla’s August 8 event may very well bring to hype back. In any case, it will be very interesting to see if what Tesla unveils will help propel the robotaxi and autonomous driving trends back into the driver’s seat again.
Only time will tell what the big day will have in store for TSLA stock and self-driving plays as a whole. Regardless, I believe they’re worth watching (and perhaps buying) as they drive into August.
Tesla (TSLA)
Source: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com
It’s been an awful year for Tesla so far, with shares down 30% year-to-date. For now, not everybody is euphoric about Tesla. It has grappled with rough industry headwinds. Furthermore, considerable negative momentum weighing down its stock.
For the first quarter of 2024, deliveries were down 8.5% as electric vehicle ( EV ) demand took a breather. There doesn’t appear to be any signs of a swift reversal ahead for Tesla or the EV industry. However, investors could begin to be more forgiving of further weak quarterly results. They may hope that August 8 will unleash something truly game-changing for the robotaxi industry.
Also, the Robotaxi event will lay out a roadmap, perhaps a multi-year one, for the gradual release of its robotaxi. And, the degree of autonomy seems unlikely to be here yet. If Musk delivers more clarity and specifics on Tesla’s longer-term robotaxi plans, the firm may beckon longer-term investors to scoop up TSLA stock on weakness.
Baidu (BIDU)
Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ) is a Chinese internet juggernaut that has not been going anywhere fast. The stock is still down over 67% from its February 2021 peak. And, seems to be sinking again after a brief rebound in the back half of 2022.
With its latest agreement to provide mapping data to Tesla to help aid its FSD tech in China, BIDU is a must-watch stock. In fact, the deal stands out as a potentially huge win for both companies as they seek to collaborate. Many may underestimate the potential for a Tesla-Baidu partnership.
Tesla aside, Baidu has been working on its own autonomous driving tech for many years. Leveraging its AI expertise with its Apollo self-driving program, Baidu is a standout way to play the future of the robotaxi and FSD scene.
At 14.3 times trailing price-to-earnings ( P/E ), Baidu stands out as a potentially glorious bargain for investors willing to venture into the hard-hit Chinese market. The company is innovating on many fronts, from generative AI to self-driving.
Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)
Robotaxi and FSD projects represent just a small piece of the pie for Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ). It seeks to defend its Google search platform from potential AI disruptors while also betting big on AI itself. With its large language model ( LLM ) of Google Gemini and its stake in private AI firm Anthropic, Alphabet is a top-two AI stock to own for the long run.
Self-driving capabilities and AI go hand-in-hand. Its Waymo division is testing the roads (without a driver) in certain areas. So, it certainly seems like the emerging robotaxi market is Alphabet’s for the taking. And yet, Waymo isn’t quite perfect yet. A notable February accident could set a nationwide rollout back by quite a bit. In any case, I do not doubt Waymo will improve by leaps and bounds over time.
As a top rival of Tesla’s robotaxi, it will be interesting to see if Alphabet has anything in store for Waymo.

2024-05-09,The 3 Most Undervalued Under-$20 Stocks to Buy in May 2024,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Since the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 have gained 6% and 10% year-to-date, now is the time to buy undervalued stocks under $20.
Investors are anticipating three rate cuts from a now dovish Federal Reserve, and even though GDP growth slowed down in Q1 , corporate profits are strong, which is often a good sign of how healthy the market is.
Investors are happy because the economy is neither too hot (which may produce inflation and an overheated economy) nor too cold (which could bring a recession)— a Goldilocks state . This equilibrium boosts stock prices; Goldman Sachs predicts the S&P 500 will rise 6% to 4,700 in 2024.
In the middle of this, we will explore three undervalued stocks under $20, all with more than 50% upside.
The first competitor, a former mobile phone service giant, is making a strong return by shifting its focus to 5G technology. The second pick works in quantum computing, a niche area expected to expand by 33% in five years. The final stock is a key oil transportation provider, profiting from increased worldwide shipping costs.
Nokia (NOK)
Source: OleksSH / Shutterstock.com
Former mobile phone giant Nokia (NYSE: NOK ) is a 5G contender, with a potential 60% upside from a $6 average price target versus the last close of $3.74.
Nokia plans to achieve a 13% operating margin by 2026 in its new company strategy and business goals. To streamline operations and focus on 5G, safety, and SaaS, Nokia will sell Lumine Group its Device Management and Service Management Platform businesses to improve efficiency for $203.1 million.
Nokia’s portfolio management is shown by its sale of VitalQIP technology to Cygna Labs Corp. and the adoption of Red Hat as its network app infrastructure. Nokia is also changing how Mobile Networks work to expand its business into O-RAN, Cloud RAN, and the military.
Patents are very important to Nokia because they protect its new ideas and keep the company ahead of the competition in the tech industry. On that note, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Samsung now have long-term technology license deals with Nokia, covering cars, media players, and consumer gadgets.
Regarding recent milestones, Nokia finished the first Cloud RAN test with In-Line acceleration for MEA, which improved mobile network technology. Additionally, Nokia and Zayo set a record for North America’s longest live network transfer distance at 800Gb/s.
Finally, Nokia is developing new products and revamping models, such as the Nokia 2660 Flip, which has new colors. It also hints at a 5G version for India, perhaps the Nokia G42 5G.
IonQ (IONQ)
Source: Amin Van / Shutterstock.com
Quantum computing play IonQ (NYSE: IONQ ) is not profitable as of yet. However, considering the allure of quantum computing, a market expected to grow at 33% between 2024 and 2029, the market opportunity is tremendous, reflected by its “Strong Buy,” rating and 86% upside potential.
But the proof is in the pudding: IonQ reached 35 algorithmic qubits on its IonQ Forte platform, one year ahead of schedule, a major engineering milestone.
IonQ also took a big step toward building future quantum networks by adding to its technology skills. It’s working on adding optical interconnects to allow processing across quantum networks, which is very different from traditional setups, where work is split up among many separate cores and processors.
IonQ also revealed that the first specialized quantum computing production plant will open in the U.S. in Bothell, Washington. This is a big step toward making quantum computing available to the public.
Additionally, IonQ’s systems are now available on almost all major cloud platforms, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, and can accessed directly through APIs.
DHT Holdings (DHT)
Source: Shutterstock
DHT Holdings (NYSE: DHT ) completes our list of undervalued stocks under $20, a large oil tanker firm potentially benefitting from global shipping price improvements.
Wall Street analysts rate DHT a “moderate buy,” with an average price goal of $19, implying 63% upside.
DHT Holdings predicted $50,900 per day from time charters in Q1 2024 in April. Its spot market and time charter VLCCs make $54,000 and $39,500 daily, respectively. Despite being lower than the spot market, the time charter rate provides steady income, but spot market charters illustrate strong demand.
Along with the $54,200 discharge-to-discharge rate, 42% of second-quarter 2024 spot days are booked. Spot and time-charter days—54% of possible earnings—are at $46,900 per day.
Geopolitical energy and transportation events benefit DHT Holdings. The oil produced worldwide could go down by 500,000 to 2 million barrels per day in a “small disruption” scenario, increasing DHT Holdings’ oil tanker demand.
Middle Eastern conflict has increased “ton-miles” (cargo volume and distance) by raising crude oil prices and road length. Very large crude carriers, or VLCCs, allow DHT’s tanker fleet to transport large amounts over long hauls during geopolitical tensions, boosting profits.
DHT Holdings will build four VLCCs in South Korea from April to December 2026, helping leverage increased demand and charter prices.

2024-05-09,The 3 Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in May 2024,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
On May 4, value investing disciples trooped to Omaha, Nebraska, for Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE: BRK-A , NYSE: BRK-B ) annual general meeting. Everyone was eager to hear what Warren Buffett had to say about the economy and Berkshire’s operations. The company’s vaunted equity portfolio is a north star for many value investors seeking the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy.
Investors always want to follow Buffett, one of the greatest value investors of our time. The Oracle of Omaha sticks to value investing principles, purchasing high-quality businesses for a reasonable price.
Due to his strict selection criteria, the portfolio comprises some of the best wide-moat businesses. Even better, Buffett states his holding period is forever. So, his picks are businesses with durable competitive advantages that can compound earnings over decades. Looking at the current portfolio, here are some of the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is the largest holding in Berkshire’s equity portfolio, accounting for nearly 40% of holdings. That’s why the markets took note when Berkshire disclosed it trimmed its stake by 13% . However, Buffett quelled any fears about AAPL stock, saying it would continue to be Berkshire’s largest holding.
The iPhone maker suffered mixed fortunes in recent quarters. Although the company’s Services segment has been growing, product revenues are on the decline. As a result, total revenues declined in five of the last six quarters.
That said, the market is forward-looking. That is why the stock rallied over 6% on May 3 after Apple posted its results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Despite the revenue decline of 4.3% from a year ago, the market took positives from management commentary that iPhone revenues could begin growing again. Particularly encouraging was the rebound in China; CEO Tim Cook stated that he was very optimistic about the Chinese market in the long term .
However, artificial intelligence is the main catalyst that makes Apple one of the best Buffett stocks to buy. Management teased its AI rollout and investors are predicting a huge announcement at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June. For now, Apple is still a cash-generating machine and a $110 billion stock buyback will provide a floor on the stock.
Berkshire owns 789.6 million shares of AAPL stock, with its overall stake valued at $143.9 billion.
Coca-Cola (KO)
Source: MAHATHIR MOHD YASIN / Shutterstock.com
In terms of returns, Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ) has been one of the best investments Buffett has made. The soft drink giant retained its moat and earned impressive returns on equity since Buffett started buying in 1988. Still, it’s among the best Buffett stocks to buy. Berkshire currently holds 400 million shares of KO stock, a stake valued at $25.1 billion and 7% of Berkshire’s total portfolio.
Scanning the equity landscape, few companies have the brand strength of Coca-Cola. It sells 1.9 billion servings each day of its popular drinks in more than 200 countries. It is the most valuable soft drink brand , giving it immense pricing power. Additionally, its global scale provides a significant cost advantage against competition.
Indeed, Q1 2024 results proved that Coca-Cola’s brand strength remains intact. The results showed that it increased prices by 13% but still grew unit case volumes by 1%. This highlights that it can raise prices without pushback from consumers.
Due to its significant profitability, Coca-Cola is also a Dividend Aristocrat —an S&P 500 company that increased its dividend for 25 consecutive years. KO recorded 61 consecutive years of dividend growth, making it one of the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy for dividends.
As of this writing, KO stock trades for 21 times forward earnings. Quench your portfolio thirst and earn a 3.1% dividend yield.
American Express (AXP)

As one of the oldest portfolio holdings, American Express (NYSE: AXP ) deserves a mention due to its durability. The credit card company has been a mainstay in Buffett’s portfolio since the 1960s. Over the years, the business grew tremendously due to the shift from cards to cash.
The move to cards is still ongoing and that’s why AXP stock is one of the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy. According to recent results, the company isn’t resting on its laurels and is executing flawlessly. On April 19, it reported first-quarter revenues increased by 11% from a year ago to $15.8 billion. What’s more, diluted EPS increased from $2.40 to $3.33, an increase of 39%.
Management noted that it saw a high engagement level among premium customers. It expects the earnings momentum to continue as the company adds more members and spending increases in their high credit-quality cohort. In line with this view, they issued 2024 guidance of 9% to 11% revenue growth and EPS of $12.65 to $13.15.
The guidance means that AXP is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 18 times. Over the long term, the bet on millennials and Gen Z presents a significant growth runway. Furthermore, with only a 6% market share in its top five international markets, there is plenty of expansion upside.
Berkshire owns 151.6 million shares of AXP stock, or just more than 20% of the company’s total shares. The stake is valued at $37.5 billion and makes up nearly 10% of Berkshire’s total portfolio.

2024-05-09,"Dividend Harvesting Portfolio Week 166: $16,600 Allocated, $1,490.16 In Projected Dividends","Amazon and Apple reported earnings, while the Fed Chair stated that a rate cut is likely unless there are significant changes.
The market interpreted a softer non-farm payroll report as a sign of a slowing economy, potentially leading to a rate cut.
The Dividend Harvesting Portfolio increased in value and generated a record amount of weekly dividend income.
This was an interesting week as Amazon ( AMZN ) and Apple ( AAPL ) were the latest big tech companies to report earnings, rates remained unchanged at the FOMC meeting , Fed Chair Powell delivered a dovish press conference , and the labor report came in softer than expected. The Fed hasn't pivoted yet, as Chair Powell stated that the Fed needs to see more data that inflation isn't going to continue upward before they start the cutting process. What Fed Chair Powell said gave the market some clarity: a move higher in rates would be unlikely, and the next move the Fed would make would be a cut unless something drastically changes. After a softer non-farm payroll report where the U.S. added 175,000 jobs when the consensus number was 243,000, it looks like the market is interpreting that this could mean the economy is slowing and that the Fed will look at this data favorably.

2024-05-09,Berkshire Hathaway's Apple Stake Reduction: Likely A Macro Decision,"Berkshire Hathaway's decision to reduce its stake in Apple, while seemingly being painted as a tax-driven decision, might have hidden nuances.
Macroeconomic data from the Federal Reserve indicate rising financial stress on ordinary Americans, while perceptions shift around the likelihood of a hard landing.
If a recession is imminent, Berkshire Hathaway's massive cash position enables it to shift focus onto recession favorites such as financials and energy - sectors it's already strong in.
On the 4th of May, asset management firm Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRK.A and BRK.B ) announced in the course of its first quarter earnings release that its biggest bet - Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) - was worth $135.4 billion, implying that the former held around 790 million shares of the latter. This meant that the ""Oracle of Omaha"" (as Berkshire Hathaway principal Warren Buffett is often referred to as) has authorized the disposal of around 116 million shares, or 13% of its total stake in Apple.
Most ""Buffettologists"" would recognize that Berkshire Hathaway's investment style isn't known to be tactical; holding ""strong for long"" is the underlying message of their methodology. Apple is certainly one such example and for good reason: unlike fellow ""Magnificent Seven"" constituent Tesla ( TSLA ), Apple has only declined a little under 2% in the Year Till Date (YTD) despite signs of sales slowdown in major market China and signs of stagnation elsewhere. Furthermore, this is the second consecutive quarter wherein the company's Apple bet was cut: in the last quarter, around 1% of its held stake was disposed of....",8

That optimistic analyst is CFRA's Angelo Zino, who pegs Apple as a buy with a price targe t of $210. That implies 15% upside from the stock's current level.
Apple is best known for its products, although it's the company's ever-growing lineup of services that's on the rise.

Apple ( AAPL ) has a cash problem. Not that it is lacking: The $2.8 trillion company produces over $100 billion of excess cash a year. But last week’s reveal that its top line shrank 4% last quarter – and an underwhelming event on Tuesday that launched upgraded iPads and a new Apple Pencil – show the company’s quandary.

Apple focuses on innovation and cost-cutting, exemplified by Apple Silicon CPUs. Net income and operating income have been growing faster than revenue.
Smartphone and consumer electronics markets show steady growth, along with potential in accessories and cloud gaming.
Near-term catalyst is device replacement cycles. Despite risks like geopolitical tensions, undervaluation and strong services growth justify a ""strong-buy"" rating.
Thesis
In my previous article on Apple Inc. ( AAPL ), I re-evaluated Apple following its Q1 2024 earnings (which were released on February 1, 2024). The fair price estimate in that article was $276.29, and the future price estimate was $403.14. This prompted an upgrade from ""buy"" to ""strong buy"".
The company released Q2 2024 earnings on May 2 . The company beat EPS and revenue estimates by a slim margin of 0.02% and 2.09% respectively. The company also increased the dividend to $0.25 per share (which is a 4% increase), as well as announced a $110B stock buyback program....",8
2024-05-08,Buffett's Banking Bets: Analyzing the 3 Largest Bank Stocks in Berkshire's Portfolio,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Even before last year’s regional banking crisis, Warren Buffett was bailing on bank stocks . Gone from the portfolio were long-time holdings like Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ), U.S. Bank (NYSE: USB ) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ).
He became disenchanted with the financial institutions and how they operated. He thought they were taking “dumb” risks and were misleading investors by using deceptive accounting tricks to pad their bottom lines. After seeing some red flags in their financial statements, Buffett dumped their shares from Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A )(NYSE: BRK-B ).
The subsequent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank seemed to prove just what Buffett was saying.
And yet Buffett didn’t sell all of his bank stocks. In fact, he owns six bank stocks, a few acquired after he dumped many of the old line banks. For example, Nu Holdings (NASDAQ: NU ), a new-fangled, all-digital Brazilian banking outfit, was bought in 2021. Recently he acquired stock in five Japanese banks , businesses he says he believes their United States counterparts could learn a lot from.
Below are three Warren Buffett bank stocks that comprise the largest holdings in Berkshire Hathaway.
Buffet’s Bank Stocks: Citigroup (C)

Citigroup (NYSE: C ) is performing more like an artificial intelligence stock than a bank stock. Shares of the financial firm are up 63% from the lows hit last October and are running 21% higher in 2024. That vindicates the support Buffett has provided the bank, which assumes almost 1% in his portfolio.
The bank is undergoing a turnaround that is supercharging the stock. It reported first-quarter results last month that were better than Wall street expected. Revenue rose 1% from last year to $21.1 billion, better than analyst expectations of $20.4 billion. Although profits dropped 28% to $1.58 per share, they were much better than the consensus outlook of $1.20 per share. But Citi has now completed its overhaul that sought to significantly reduce costs, in part by effecting dramatic job cuts. It is also selling off over a dozen retail banking businesses.
Banking was Citi’s top-performing segment in the quarter as revenue jumped 49% on the surprising strength of investment banking and corporate lending. The bank’s return on tangible common equity improved dramatically to 9.9% from 1% last year and a negative 6.6% in the fourth quarter.
Buffett owns 55.2 million shares of Citigroup, or 2.9% of the bank’s outstanding shares.
American Express (AXP)
Source: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com
Thought of as mostly as credit card company, American Express (NYSE: AXP ) also offers savings accounts and certificates of deposit online. It also has an online bank called American Express National Bank with savings and checking accounts.
American Express is one of Buffett’s oldest holdings, first acquired back in 1991. Remarkably, he has not bought a single share of AmEx since the late 1990s but time and the effects of compounding allowed it to become the fourth biggest position in Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio. Buffett owns 151.6 million shares of the financial company or 21.1% of the total outstanding shares. With the stake valued at $35.4 billion, American Express occupies nearly 10% of the portfolio’s total.
AmEx also reported better-than-expected results with net interest income (NII), or the amount of money it earns from customers who keep a balance on their accounts, jumping 26% from last year. Not everyone fears the higher interest rates the Federal Reserve is charging. But by also targeting a younger demographic , American Express is enjoying significant growth. Chairman and CEO Stephen Squeri said  millennials and Gen Z consumers “accounted for over 60 percent of new consumer account acquisitions globally.”
Bank of America (BAC)
Source: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.com
The premiere Warren Buffett bank stock is Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ). It was also one of the bank stocks he was buying as the regional banking crisis shook faith in the country’s financial foundations. It took his holdings to over 1 billion shares , or 13.2% of the outstanding total.
At today’s prices, that stake is valued it at $38.8 billion, only surpassed by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) at $144 billion. As it is, the bank represents 10.7% of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio.
The financial giant, one of the biggest banks in the country, has also benefited from high interest rates boosting NII. While it also increased unrealized losses , Bank of America should be able to outlast the storm until those assets come to maturity. The stock market appreciates the stability the bank offers as shares have shot 50% higher from their lows and stand 12% above where they started 2024.
There is no indication Buffett plans to pare his stake in Bank of America as he has been doing with Apple and it will remain a stalwart of Berkshire Hathaway.

2024-05-08,3 Tech Stock Darlings to Scoop Up After Q2 earnings,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Over the past year, advancements in artificial intelligence ( AI ), cloud computing and cybersecurity propelled the tech sector to new Wall Street heights. As a result, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index has returned over 35% in the past 12 months. Now that we are well into the second-quarter earnings season, investors are looking for tech stocks to buy after earnings.
Despite the decline in the tech sector in April, many positive earnings surprises across sectors have led to renewed optimism on Wall Street. And, the “Magnificent Seven” stocks, namely Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) (NASDAQ: GOOG ), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ), are once again on investors’ radars.
Analysts have also been endorsing a number of tech darlings, especially citing AI’s role in the sector’s growth. For instance, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) recently raised Apple’s target price post-earnings , noting the quarterly performance, stock buyback and hints at AI updates to come. With that in mind, let’s explore three tech stocks to to buy after earnings.
Amazon (AMZN)
Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com
The first company is Amazon, which reported impressive Q1 2024 financials on April 30. Revenues surged 13% year-over-year ( YOY ) to $143 billion, driven by strong e-commerce and Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) performance. Net income tripled to $10.4 billion, or 98 cents per diluted share, compared to the same period last year. Additionally, the company’s free cash flow surged to $50 billion. This is a notable improvement from the $3.3 billion outflow in the previous year.
Apart from a strong retail business fueled by robust consumer demand, Amazon’s strategic emphasis on AI infrastructure positions it for further growth. Innovations such as the Trainium and Inferentia chips optimize machine learning tasks, ensuring efficiency. Furthermore, the AI services platform, Bedrock, streamlines deployment and customization . And, third-party applications utilizing Amazon’s infrastructure expand its market presence and reach.
As a result, AMZN stock has gained 22% year-to-date ( YTD ). Meanwhile, the shares are changing hands at 41 times forward earnings and three times trailing sales. Despite the relatively high valuation, analysts foresee further upside. They set a 12-month price target of $220, suggesting an 18% potential increase from current levels. Interested investors may consider the $180 level as a better entry point into Amazon shares.
iShares U.S. Technology ETF (IYW)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices , noted that the information technology and communication services sectors, which comprise the majority of the tech industry, drove over 70% of the S&P 500 ’s total return of 26.3% in 2023. The “Magnificent Seven” played a significant role in this rally, contributing around 60% of the index’s total return.
Therefore, the iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSEARCA: IYW ) stands out as a compelling choice . This ETF provides a gateway to a diverse group of U.S. tech companies, reflecting a blend of established players and innovative disruptors.
Since its inception in May 2000, IYW has demonstrated remarkable growth, now boasting net assets totaling $16 billion. The fund offers a comprehensive portfolio comprising 131 holdings, with the top ten commanding approximately 65% of the allocation.
Among its leading holdings are tech giants Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Alphabet. The fund maintains a diversified spread across sectors, including Software & Services (40%), Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment (30%), Tech Hardware & Equipment (18%) and Media & Entertainment (10%).
IYW is up nearly 8% YTD and has gained almost 44% over the past 12 months, outperforming the broad S&P 500 index as well as the Nasdaq 100 index. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios stand at around 36.5x and 9.5x, respectively. Finally, investors should note IYW’s expense ratio of 0.4%.
Qualcomm (QCOM)
Source: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com
Our final pick among top tech stocks to buy earnings is Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ). The leading global provider of semiconductor solutions and wireless technology operates through Qualcomm CDMA Technologies ( QCT ) and Qualcomm Technology Licensing ( QTL ). QCT generates revenue from chipsets for the telecommunications industry, while QTL manages patent licensing.
Recently, QCOM stock hit an all-time high after releasing impressive second-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings. The company reported $9.4 billion in non-GAAP revenues, a 1% increase from the previous year’s quarter, and $2.44 in diluted earnings per share, a 13% rise YOY that exceeded guidance. Notably, QCT Automotive saw exceptional growth, with a 35% surge in revenues due to expanded content in new vehicle launches featuring Snapdragon Digital Chassis products.
Investors have been following the anticipated demand for AI-equipped premium smartphones. Going forward, the company’s strategic diversification into emerging sectors like automotive, IoT and networking underscores Qualcomm’s commitment to long-term sustainability and revenue diversification.
So far in 2024, QCOM shares have returned 24%, and currently trade at around 19 times forward earnings and six times trailing sales, indicating a relatively premium valuation. Nonetheless, analysts’ price targets of $185 still imply an average upside potential of 3% from current levels. Finally, the stock also offers a 1.9% dividend yield.

2024-05-08,PayPal Stock Analysis: Why PYPL Is Still a Huge Bargain Right Now,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
In a column about PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL ) published on Oct. 19, 2023, I wrote that “PYPL stock trades at bargain-basement levels and has a new, up-and-coming CEO. Additionally, I believe the Street is overly worried about threats to PayPal’s dominance.” And I advised investors to “buy the shares on weakness.”
That turned out to be pretty good advice as shares jumped 20% between Oct. 19 and May 6. Also noteworthy is that, during the same period, the shares of SoFi (NASDAQ: SOFI ), a popular fintech name that I’ve been bearish on, fell 6%. And now, after PayPal reported standout first-quarter results and with its shares still trading at very low valuations, I continue to recommend that growth-at-a-reasonable-price investors buy the shares. Also importantly, the company has multiple, potential and strong positive catalysts.
PayPal’s Strong Q1 Results
The fintech giant’s top line advanced 9.4% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier to $7.7 billion while its total payment volume (TPV) jumped an impressive 14% year-over-year ( YOY ) to $404 billion and its earnings per share rose 27% YOY to $1.08.
The company’s continued strong revenue and TPV growth show that the Street’s worries about the firm losing market share to Apple ‘s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Apple Pay are completely unfounded. And the large increase in its EPS suggests that the cost controls implemented by the firm’s new CEO Alex Chriss are bearing fruit.
Low Valuation + Positive Catalysts = Buy
Despite the recent, strong gains of PayPal stock, the name’s valuation continues to be exceptionally low and attractive.
Indeed, the shares have a forward price-earnings ratio of 15.3x and an enterprise value/EBITDA ratio of 9.2 times. Given PayPal’s rapid revenue growth and the large increase in its profits, I believe that the stock remains extremely undervalued.
On the catalyst front, the firm is testing a new, fast checkout feature. According to Chriss, almost 80% of the consumers who have used the feature in tests utilize PayPal to pay when they check out again. Moreover, the conversion rates of the merchants who use it rise about 10%, the CEO reported.
Given these points, I believe that this offering will significantly increase PayPal’s payment volumes while enabling it to convince more vendors to utilize its platform.
Chriss also indicated that the firm is working harder than under his predecessor to market its fraud-prevention solution. Finally, PayPal has been convincing more small and medium businesses to use its Complete Payments suite. The CEO indicated that the companies that utilize this offering use more of PayPal’s products.
Finally, Chriss suggested that he would meaningfully increase the company’s low prices going forward.
Over the longer term, I expect these initiatives, taken together, to enable the growth of PayPal’s top and bottom lines to meaningfully accelerate.
Plenty of runway for growth
There are other indications besides the low valuation of the shares which suggest that the name can advance a great deal.
First,the average price target of Street analysts on the stock is $71.48, meaningfully above its current price of around $65. Second, out of 35 analysts who cover the name, only 15 of them have “buy” ratings on the shares. As more of these analysts “see the light” and upgrade the shares, they are likely to rise meaningfully.
Finally, the shares have a low Relative Strength rating of 48 and an average Accumulation/Distribution rating of C, according to Investor’s Business Daily . These metrics indicate that the stock has underperformed in the last year, while institutions have not bought a great deal of its in the last 13 weeks. As many more investors realize that PayPal stock is a bargain ,the shares should rally a great deal.

2024-05-08,Which Credit Bureau Stock Should You Buy for the Long-Term?,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
When you write about the markets as much as I do, finding subjects to cover is challenging. A recent New York Times article about “Pay Later” lenders gave me an idea about credit bureau stocks to buy.
The Times article discussed how credit bureaus want to start including “buy now, pay later” purchases on consumer credit reports and credit scores.
This was prompted by Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) February move to start reporting loans made through its Apple Pay Later service to Experian (OTCMKTS: EXPGY ), one of the three main credit bureaus.
A major issue with not reporting the loans is that it creates what experts call “phantom debt.” The credit bureaus argue that by including them, consumers are building credit. Pay-later lenders argue that each purchase makes a separate loan, hurting a consumer’s credit score.
Ultimately, the Times article concluded that pay-later firms will either be forced by regulators to report pay-later loans or market forces, such as loan delinquencies, will get them to act.
Either way, the three credit bureaus —Experian, TransUnion (NYSE: TRU ), and Equifax (NYSE: EFX )—should remain integral to the lending industry.
One’s a Buy, one’s a Hold, and one’s a Sell.
Experian (EXPGY)
Source: ©iStock.com/ebstock
Seventeen analysts cover Experian. Of those, 14 rate it a Buy, with a $44.94 target price, about 9% higher than its current share price. Of the three stocks, Experian has the highest approval rating from analysts.
Experian’s investor relations website cites five reasons why you should invest in the company: 1) It’s a market leader, 2) it has a purpose-driven growth strategy, 3) it has a sustainable focus and strong commitment to ESG, 4) it is financially sound, and 5) it has a rock-solid foundation for growth.
That’s corporate speak, for it’s one heck of a company.
In its latest presentation, the company points out that its 2023 revenue of $6.62 billion was higher than Equifax ($5.12 billion) and TransUnion ($3.71 billion). Further, it has the most globally diverse revenue, with 33% outside North America compared to 22% and 20% for the other two, respectively.
The company estimates its global addressable market opportunity is $150 billion annually. That’s a double-edged sword. On the one hand, there’s tremendous growth potential. On the other hand, it’s not going to be easy or cheap to grab a bigger piece of the pie.
When in doubt, I look to free cash flow to decide if a company has what it takes for the long haul. In 2023, it was $1.11 billion , down from $1.31 billion a year earlier. Based on an enterprise value of $41.34 billion , it has a free cash flow yield of 2.7%. Anything under 4% is overvalued.
Experian is a Buy.
TransUnion (TRU)

TransUnion is covered by 20 analysts . Of those, 16 rate it a Buy, with a $90.00 target price, about 14% higher than its current share price.
As I wrote in the previous section, TransUnion has the lowest annual revenue of the three credit bureaus. However, it’s nearly doubled since hitting a 52-week low of $42.09 in November 2023. Here’s why.
In Q1 2024, TransUnion delivered $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time in its history, up 8%, excluding currency, to $1.02 billion. Every region experienced a year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, its adjusted net income for the quarter was $179 million, 16% higher than Q1 2023.
“We are raising our 2024 guidance following first quarter outperformance and now expect to deliver 5 to 6.5 percent revenue growth for the year. We remain focused on driving strong results in a low-growth market environment, with no assumed in-year benefits from interest rate cuts,” stated CEO Chris Cartwright in its Q1 2024 press release.
In 2023, TransUnion’s free cash flow was $334.70 million . Based on an enterprise value of $20.08 billion , it has a free cash flow yield of 1.7%. Anything under 4% is overvalued.
TransUnion is a Hold.
Equifax (EFX)
Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.com
Equifax is covered by 23 analysts . Of those, 18 rate it a Buy, with a $267.30 target price, about 16% higher than its current share price.
Over the past year, Equifax stock has increased 15%, less than TransUnion, which has increased 21%, or Experian, which has increased 21.5%. That’s the bad news. The good news is that Equifax has significantly outperformed its two competitors over the past five years.
Equifax was founded in Atlanta in 1899 as Retail Credit Company . It changed its name to Equifax in 1975 .
Equifax reported its Q1 2024 results in mid-April. Revenues, excluding currency, increased by 8% to $1.39 billion, while its net income rose 11% to $124.9 million. For all of 2024, it expects revenue of $5.72 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, 8.5% higher than 2023, with adjusted earnings per share of $7.35, 9.5% higher than a year ago .
In 2023, Equifax’s free cash flow was $515.5 million [operating cash flow of $1.12 billion less $601.3 million in capital expenditures], up considerably from 2023. Based on an enterprise value of $33.64 billion , it has a free cash flow yield of 1.5%. Anything under 4% is overvalued.
Equifax is a Sell.

2024-05-07,"Forget the ""Magnificent Seven"": 1 TSX Tech Stock to Buy Instead","The ‘Magnificent Seven’ have certainly proven to be quite magnificent over the last few years. These companies include Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG )( NASDAQ:GOOGL ), Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ), Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), Meta ( NASDAQ:META ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) and Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ). In fact, the seven largest stocks by market cap on the S&P 500 were pretty much holding up the index, taking up about 30% of the overall index.
So while it looked like the S&P 500 was doing really well, it really came down to these absolutely enormous companies. And that led many investors to have a few worries. So let’s get into what those worries were, and why there’s another TSX tech stock to consider instead.
Worry flurry
The fear was that with the S&P 500 running higher and higher due to the heavy investment in these seven companies, should the companies drop the market could crash. And while that didn’t exactly happen, there was proof of the hypothesis on the markets.
The ‘Magnificent Seven’ reported their earnings near the beginning of 2024, and each did quite well overall. This led to a surge in the S&P 500, with shares continuing to rise higher and higher between January and the end of March.
However, by the time earnings started to come forward once more, and there was still no drop in interest rates, investors began to fear the positivity would’t continue. This led to a drop in the S&P 500, with investments in major companies like Nvidia stock seeing a massive drop in share price.
Consider sectors
That’s why the historically safe S&P 500 hasn’t been all that safe recently. Until there is more exposure to other companies and areas of the market, I would instead consider diversifying. And that should mean looking at strong sectors that are due to continue rising.
One area is the market of semiconductors . As mentioned, shares of Nvidia stock rose higher as the company not only demonstrated its worth in current earnings, but expects even more in the future.
Yet shares of Nvidia stock are now quite expensive. With that in mind, I would instead look at companies that are involved in the semiconductor process. And Celestica ( TSX:CLS ) is perhaps the best option on the TSX today.
Why Celestica stock?
There are many reasons to consider Celestica stock on the TSX today, especially if you’re looking to invest in semiconductors stocks. Celestica stock operates in the semiconductor industry as a provider of manufacturing services and solutions for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Investing in Celestica can provide diversification within the semiconductor sector, as it offers exposure to semiconductor-related activities beyond semiconductor manufacturing itself.
Furthermore, Celestica offers a range of supply chain services, including design, engineering, manufacturing, and aftermarket services. This diversification of services can mitigate some of the risks associated with pure-play semiconductor companies that may be more exposed to fluctuations in chip demand or pricing.
The company has proven its worth as well, seeing shares surge by 303% in the last year alone! And yet as of writing, shares are below 52-week highs. Therefore, it’s a great time for investors to consider picking up Celestica stock on the TSX today. Especially if they want to get away from the over-exposure of the “Magnificent Seven” stocks.

2024-05-07,New Apple M4 Chip Threatens to Dethrone Nvidia (NVDA) Stock,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
One tech leader is gearing up to challenge Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) as a powerful new rival. Indeed, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) reportedly wants to produce its own chips for artificial intelligence ( AI ) software in data centers. According to The Wall Street Journal , the company has been working on this device — internally codenamed Project ACDC (Apple Chips in Data Center) — for years.
Apple hasn’t officially commented on this server project yet. But it recently reminded investors that it’s taking major steps toward cementing its place in the AI race. Today, the tech firm also announced that its M4 system on a chip (SoC) will power the new iPad Pro. AAPL stock closed the day in the green amid growing enthusiasm for the Silicon Valley darling.
Of course, this is good news for Apple. But if the company’s foray into AI and chips continues, Nvidia may finally have an opponent to seriously threaten its market share.
AAPL Stock in the Age of the M4 Chip
Tech enthusiasts would likely have lined up for the new iPad Pro no matter what. But with the added incentive of a powerful new chip helping usher in a new stage of the AI revolution, interest in this sleek new device will be even higher. With that in mind, it’s easy to see why AAPL stock surged today and NVDA stock dipped, as the threat of a dangerous new competitor may be beginning to loom.
What makes the M4 chip special? Apple provided an in-depth overview of why this innovation matters for both investors and consumers:
“[The] M4 has Apple’s fastest Neural Engine ever, capable of up to 38 trillion operations per second, which is faster than the neural processing unit of any AI PC today. Combined with faster memory bandwidth, along with next-generation machine learning ( ML ) accelerators in the CPU, and a high-performance GPU, M4 makes the new iPad Pro an outrageously powerful device for artificial intelligence.”
This catalyst is likely exactly what Apple needs to bolster to its place as a pillar of Silicon Valley. Despite some recent momentum, AAPL stock remains in the red so far this year and some experts have expressed concern . One analyst at Barclays recently reiterated a “sell” rating on AAPL stock. Still, it’s hard to keep a sector leader down — and Apple has repeatedly proven its resilience and ability to continue innovating.
What Comes Next?
Apple is zeroing in on the next phase of AI technology all while the red-hot artificial intelligence market continues to surge. The company’s new M4 chip could signal a turning point for the tech giant and, as more updates on ACDC are released, AAPL stock may rise even further.
All told, Apple is in an excellent position to secure a piece of this lucrative space.

2024-05-07,3 Nasdaq Darlings With Hidden Upside Potential,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
As the stock market starts to pick up where it left off before running into April turbulence, value investors should be willing to give undervalued Nasdaq stocks a look. Some are cheaper after the latest round of earnings season, which was met with mixed results across the board.
In any case, don’t bet against the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 now that it’s regained most of the ground it has lost in an ugly April. As the bull market commences, the following undervalued Nasdaq stocks are worth adding to the watchlist as tech momentum and Fed jitters ease. At the same time, quarterly earnings take a front-row seat.
The following undervalued Nasdaq stocks are among the timelier bets on the market, even if the latest earnings “bump” causes some investors to depart.
Starbucks (SBUX)
Source: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com
It was really hard to get over just how terrible the latest quarterly earnings results were for Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ). The firm lowered full-year sales and earnings expectations while clocking in a sudden drop in profits. It was not only a bad showing by its new CEO, Laxman Narasimhan, but it seems like the Starbucks growth thesis is broken as we know it.
Legendary Starbucks founder and ex-top boss Howard Schultz recently commented on the matter, noting that its locations need a “maniacal focus on the customer experience,” Indeed, it appears Narasimhan has been doing his best to improve things at the store level (he’s taken shifts at Starbucks), but to no avail.
You can’t fault Starbucks entirely for the rough patch, though. The broader quick-serve restaurant scene has been rocked lately, with consumers responding to widespread price increases by putting away their wallets. Starbucks has just felt the industry hit a bit harder.
I think Schultz, a notable “boomerang CEO,” may need to make another return to the helm if Starbucks’ latest crisis worsens. The stock has now shed around 42% of its value from its 2021 highs. That’s some serious underperformance that perhaps only Schultz may know how to solve. Either way, the stock looks super cheap right here.
Adobe (ADBE)
Source: Tattoboo / Shutterstock
Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) seems to be in an enviable position to monetize emerging generative artificial intelligence ( AI ) technologies as it brings its creative suite user base to this new era. That said, the stock hasn’t been booming of late compared to most other companies looking to tap into AI to jolt sales growth. The stock is down 15% year to date, while most other AI stocks have been gaining.
Indeed, it’s hard to be enthused about Adobe’s AI capabilities when incredible AI image generators Midjourney and OpenAI’s Dall-E may find themselves nipping at Adobe’s heels over the coming years. Despite this, I view Adobe as a Nasdaq darling and AI underdog that could have plenty of surprises up its sleeves as it continues rolling out new AI innovations.
More recently, the firm made a big splash in the realm of AI video generation and editing . From text-to-video to AI-assisted video editing in Premier Pro, it’s clear Adobe wants a big piece of the AI creative market.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock recently shocked investors with a historic $110 billion buyback announcement. The big buyback news and some better-than-expected quarterly numbers were enough to propel AAPL stock around 7%.
It will be interesting to see where Apple goes from here as it moves on from its two-year period of relative sluggishness. The stock is currently trading at 28.26 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) — not exactly cheap for a firm that’s run into a bit of a growth slump.
AI rumors could certainly pick up traction as we inch closer to the second half. But could we be looking at a buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news situation regarding AI?
As always, only time will tell. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to value Apple shares here, with Warren Buffett recently announcing that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B ) had slashed its stake by 13%.

The all-new Logic Pro for iPad and Mac delivers breakthrough music-making experiences. (Photo: Business Wire)
“Logic Pro gives creatives everything they need to write, produce, and mix a great song, and our latest features take that creativity to a whole new level,” said Brent Chiu-Watson, Apple’s senior director of Apps Worldwide Product Marketing. “Logic Pro’s new AI-backed updates, combined with the unparalleled performance of iPad, Mac, and M-series Apple silicon, provide creative pros with the best music creation experience in the industry.”
Session Players: A Personalized AI-Driven Backing Band
Session Players offer groundbreaking experiences for creators by providing a personal, AI-driven backing band that responds directly to feedback. 1 Drummer took the music creation industry by storm when it debuted as one of the world’s first generative musicians more than a decade ago. Today, it gets even better with key improvements and the addition of a new virtual Bass Player and Keyboard Player. Session Players augment the live-playing experience while ensuring artists maintain full agency during any phase of their music-making process.
Bass Player was trained in collaboration with today’s best bass players using advanced AI and sampling technologies. Users can choose from eight different Bass Players and guide their performance with controls for complexity and intensity, while leveraging advanced parameters for slides, mutes, dead notes, and pickup hits. Bass Player can jam along with chord progressions, or users can choose from 100 Bass Player loops to draw new inspiration. With Chord Track, users can define and edit the chord progressions to a song, and the virtual Bass Player will follow along perfectly. Plus, with Studio Bass plug-in, users gain access to six new, meticulously recorded instruments, from acoustic to electric — all inspired by the sounds of today’s most popular bass tones and genres.
With Keyboard Player, users can choose from four different styles, designed in cooperation with top studio musicians and made to accompany a wide variety of music genres. Keyboard Player can play everything from simple block chords to chord voicing with extended harmony — with nearly endless variations. Like Bass Player, Chord Track adds and edits the chord progression of the song, so Keyboard Player follows along. Using Studio Piano plug-in, users can select additional sound-shaping options, with the ability to adjust three mic positions, pedal noise, key noise, release samples, and sympathetic resonance.
Stem Splitter: Recover Great Recordings
Most musicians perform their best without the pressure of a formal studio session. These moments are often found in Voice Memos recordings, an old demo cassette tape, or are captured from a live show. Listening back, these recordings can reveal magical performances that are nearly impossible to re-create, making them lost to time. Now, with Stem Splitter, an artist can recover moments of inspiration from any audio file and separate nearly any mixed audio recording into four distinct parts: Drums, Bass, Vocals, and Other instruments, right on the device. 2 With these tracks separated, it’s easy to apply effects, add new parts, or change the mix. Powered by AI and M-series Apple silicon, Stem Splitter is lightning fast.
ChromaGlow: Dial in the Perfect Tone
ChromaGlow models the sounds produced by a blend of the world’s most revered studio hardware by leveraging AI and the power of M-series Apple silicon. 3 Users can dial in the perfect tone with five different saturation styles to add ultrarealistic warmth, presence, and punch to any track. They can also choose from modern clean sounds, nostalgic vintage warmth, or more extreme styles that can be shaped and molded to taste.
Powered by iPad and Mac
Since its introduction last year, Logic Pro for iPad has seen rapid adoption from creatives. Designed from the ground up to take full advantage of touch, Logic Pro transforms iPad into almost any instrument imaginable, and thanks to the portable design of iPad, it becomes a complete studio experience on the go. With the power and performance of Apple silicon, musicians can complete complex multitrack projects, create custom software instrument sounds, leverage a full-featured professional mixer, and explore the app’s vast collection of effects plug-ins.
Working between iPad and Mac is easy with project round-tripping, allowing users to make music while on the go and continue perfecting their project when back in the studio.
Pricing and Availability
Logic Pro for Mac 11 is available on May 13 as a free update for existing users and for $199.99 (U.S.) for new users on the Mac App Store. Logic Pro for Mac 11 requires macOS® Ventura 13.5 or later. For more information, visit apple.com/logic-pro .

With an entirely new display engine, M4 introduces pioneering technology for the stunning precision, color, and brightness of the Ultra Retina XDR display. The new CPU offers up to four performance cores and now six efficiency cores, 2 with next-generation machine learning (ML) accelerators, to deliver up to 1.5x faster CPU performance over M2 in the previous-generation iPad Pro. 3 M4 builds on the GPU architecture of M3 — the 10-core GPU includes powerful features like Dynamic Caching, and hardware-accelerated mesh shading and ray tracing, which come to iPad for the first time. Coupled with higher unified memory bandwidth, pro rendering apps like Octane will see up to 4x faster performance than M2. 3 M4 also delivers tremendous gains and industry-leading performance per watt. Compared to M2, M4 can deliver the same performance using just half the power, and compared to the latest PC chip in a thin and light laptop, M4 can deliver the same performance using just a quarter of the power. 4 A new advanced Media Engine includes support for AV1 decode, providing more power-efficient playback of high-resolution video experiences from streaming services.
Outrageously Powerful Device for AI
The new iPad Pro with M4 features Apple’s most powerful Neural Engine ever, capable of 38 trillion operations per second, which is 60x faster than Apple’s first Neural Engine in the A11 Bionic chip. Combined with next-generation ML accelerators in the CPU, a high-performance GPU, more memory bandwidth, and intelligent features and powerful developer frameworks in iPadOS®, the Neural Engine makes the new iPad Pro an outrageously powerful device for AI. With iPad Pro with M4, users can perform AI-enabled tasks even faster, like easily isolate a subject from its background in 4K video with just a tap with Scene Removal Mask in Final Cut Pro®. With this advanced level of performance, the Neural Engine in M4 is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC today.
iPadOS also has advanced frameworks like Core ML® that make it easy for developers to tap into the Neural Engine to deliver phenomenal AI features locally, including running powerful diffusion and generative AI models, with great performance on device. iPad Pro also supports cloud-based solutions, enabling users to run powerful productivity and creative apps that tap into the power of AI, such as Copilot for Microsoft 365 and Adobe Firefly.
Pro Cameras
The updated camera system on the new iPad Pro delivers even more versatility, and with its rich audio from four studio-quality mics, users can shoot, edit, and share all on one device. The 12MP back camera captures vibrant Smart HDR images and video with even better color, improved textures, and detail in low light. It also now features a new adaptive True Tone® flash that makes document scanning on the new iPad Pro better than ever. Using AI, the new iPad Pro automatically identifies documents right in the Camera app, and if a shadow is in the way, it instantly takes multiple photos with the new adaptive flash, stitching the scan together for a dramatically better scan.
On the front, the TrueDepth® camera system moves to the landscape location on the new iPad Pro. The Ultra Wide 12MP camera with Center Stage® makes the experience of video conferencing in landscape orientation even better, especially when iPad is attached to a Magic Keyboard or Smart Folio®.
Pro Connectivity
iPad Pro includes a high-performance USB-C connector with support for Thunderbolt 3 and USB 4, delivering fast wired connectivity — up to 40Gb/s. Thunderbolt supports an extensive ecosystem of high-performance accessories, including external displays like the Pro Display XDR at its full 6K resolution, and external storage, all connected using high-performance cables and docks. iPad Pro supports Wi-Fi 6E for super-fast Wi-Fi connections for pro workflows on the go. Wi-Fi + Cellular models with 5G allow users to access their files, communicate with colleagues, and back up their data in a snap while on the go. Cellular models of the new iPad Pro are activated with eSIM, a more secure alternative to a physical SIM card, allowing users to quickly connect and transfer their existing plans digitally, and store multiple cellular plans on a single device. Customers can easily get connected to wireless data plans on the new iPad Pro in over 190 countries and regions around the world without needing to get a physical SIM card from a local carrier.
Apple Pencil Pro
Apple Pencil Pro features even more magical capabilities and powerful new interactions that take the Apple Pencil® experience even further. A new sensor in the barrel can sense a user’s squeeze, bringing up a tool palette to quickly switch tools, line weights, and colors, all without interrupting the creative process. A custom haptic engine delivers a light tap that provides confirmation when users squeeze, use double-tap, or snap to a Smart Shape for a remarkably intuitive experience. A gyroscope allows users to roll Apple Pencil Pro for precise control of the tool they’re using. Rotating the barrel changes the orientation of shaped pen and brush tools, just like pen and paper. And with Apple Pencil hover, users can visualize the exact orientation of a tool before making a mark.
With these advanced features, Apple Pencil Pro allows users to bring their ideas to life in entirely new ways, and developers can also create their own custom interactions. Apple Pencil Pro brings support for Find My® for the first time to Apple Pencil, helping users locate Apple Pencil Pro if misplaced. It pairs, charges, and is stored on the side of iPad Pro through a new magnetic interface. iPad Pro also supports Apple Pencil (USB-C), ideal for note taking, sketching, annotating, journaling, and more, at an incredible value.
All-New Magic Keyboard and Smart Folio
Designed for the new iPad Pro, an all-new thinner and lighter Magic Keyboard makes it more portable and versatile than ever. The new Magic Keyboard opens to the magical floating design that customers love, and now includes a function row for access to features like screen brightness and volume controls. It also has a gorgeous aluminum palm rest and larger trackpad that’s even more responsive with haptic feedback, so the entire experience feels just like using a MacBook®. The new Magic Keyboard attaches magnetically, and the Smart Connector® immediately connects power and data without the need for Bluetooth. The machined aluminum hinge also includes a USB-C connector for charging. The new Magic Keyboard comes in two colors that perfectly complement the new iPad Pro: black with a space black aluminum palm rest, and white with a silver aluminum palm rest.
The new Smart Folio for iPad Pro attaches magnetically and now supports multiple viewing angles for greater flexibility. Available in black, white, and denim, it complements the colors of the new iPad Pro.
Powerful iPadOS Features
iPadOS is packed with features that push the boundaries of what’s possible on iPad. With Reference Mode, iPadOS can precisely match color requirements of the Ultra Retina XDR display for tasks in which accurate colors and consistent image quality are critical — including review and approve, color grading, and compositing. Stage Manager® enables users to work with multiple overlapping windows in a single view, resize windows, tap to switch between apps, and more. With full external display support of up to 6K, iPad Pro users can also extend their workflow, as well as use the built-in camera on an external display for enhanced video conferencing. Users can take advantage of the powerful AI capabilities in iPad Pro and intelligent features in iPadOS, including Visual Look Up, Subject Lift, Live Text®, or Live Captions and Personal Voice for accessibility.
With iPadOS 17 , users can customize the Lock Screen to make it more personal — taking advantage of the larger display on iPad — and interactive widgets take glanceable information further with the ability to get tasks done right in the moment with just a tap. The Notes app gives users new ways to organize, read, annotate, and collaborate on PDFs, and working with PDFs is also easier with AutoFill, which intelligently identifies and fills fields in forms.

2024-05-07,RIVN Stock Alert: Is Rivian About to Partner With Apple?,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Stock in electric vehicle (EV) maker Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN ) rose on rumors it may partner with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ).
Apple recently canceled its plans to build an “Apple Car” but may still be interested in the space, according to trade magazine reports.
RIVN stock rose 9% overnight and is expected to open this morning at about $11 per share, its market capitalization rising to nearly $11 billion. Apple was up 1% overnight and is now worth about $2.8 trillion.
Apple of Its Eye
I recently suggested that Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) should fire CEO Elon Musk and buy Rivian . I know that’s not happening. In the article, I called TSLA a stock to sell.
But the Apple story reflects the impulse leading to my story, Rivian’s growing reputation in EV circles. It is now seen as a company that understands the business and can scale to meet its cost challenges.
Rivian’s R3 announcement turned the industry on its head. The R3 will be a mid-size car at a mid-sized car price when it’s built in 2026 or 2027. Meanwhile, Rivian faces the challenge of selling its $45,000 R2 in quantities sufficient to justify the cost of a new plant in Georgia.
An Apple connection would bring Rivian an improved user interface and entertainment system . It would also give Rivian a second deep-pocketed benefactor alongside Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). They got the company started five years ago with an order for 100,000 electric delivery vans .
A Rivian connection would offer Apple much less risk than building its own car. Success could lead it to purchase Rivian, at least in the minds of some Rivian shareholders.
RIVN Stock: What Happens Next?
It’s possible that nothing happens as a result of all this press coverage. But the story is still intriguing enough to put smiles on the faces of both companies’ shareholders.
As of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had a LONG position in AMZN and AAPL. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines .

2024-05-07,Apple: The Real Reasons Warren Buffett Is Selling,"Warren Buffett's decision to sell Apple shares is likely driven by concerns over short-term profit prioritization, weakening market position, and increasing regulatory and geopolitical risks.
Apple's failure to deliver innovative projects like Project ""Titan"" and increasing competition, particularly from rivals like Xiaomi, should worry investors.
High valuation multiples, stagnant growth, and various risks including regulatory investigations and supply chain dependencies could further justify Buffett's decision to trim Berkshire's Apple stake.
When our long-term competitive position improves as a result of these almost unnoticeable actions, we describe the phenomenon as “widening the moat.” And doing that is essential if we are to have the kind of business we want a decade or two from now. We always, of course, hope to earn more money in the short-term. But when short-term and long-term conflict, widening the moat must take precedence.

2024-05-07,Caution! Why SoundHound AI Stock May Be All Bark and No Bite.,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN ) creates voice artificial intelligence ( AI ) solutions that enables businesses across various sectors to develop AI-driven conversational experiences for their customers. Due to the AI craze that’s caught the market by storm, SOUN shares have more than doubled in 2024, but the party could be over. A short seller report, a lack of profitability and weighty valuation could make things worse for SOUN shareholders. For those looking to invest now, here are 3 reasons to exercise some serious caution.
Short Seller Report: SOUN’s AI product is not unique
Once generative AI came to the mainstream in 2023, the company launched SoundHound Chat AI, which integrates with knowledge domains. It pulls real-time data like weather, sports, stocks, flight status and restaurants create an AI-powered voice assistant experience. Moreover, when Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) revealed it had a stake in the company, AI investors quickly added SOUN shares to their portfolio.
However, a pretty damning report from short seller Capybara Research has underscored why they may have made a mistake. Like all short seller reports, not every single allegation is necessarily 100% true, but many are grounded in thorough research and should be taken seriously. Capybara Research claimed “The Houndify product uses commodity speech recognition to search a manually programmed knowledge graph.” This basically means the algorithms undergirding the Houndify platform are nothing special and could easily be replicated by other companies.
Moreover, the report says SoundHound’s product is not fundamentally different from speech-recognition products already rolled out by tech giants including Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Google.
No real pathway to profitability
SoundHound’s year-over-year revenue growth has already started to stall since the macroeconomic environment became pretty unstable. According to Koyfin, SoundHound delivered solid double-digit revenue growth in 2023 but this was below that of prior years.
As the short seller report highlighted, SoundHound has lost some major customers that the company admitted were crucial to the business. These customers include Mercedes-Benz (OTCMKTS: MBGYY ), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Deutsche Telekom (OTCMKTS: DTEGY ). The loss of top customers coupled with the company’s product not being so unique, could make profitability difficult for SoundHound.
Valuation has become pretty rich
The rally that catapulted U.S. equities to frothier valuations in first quarter ended abruptly in the second quarter. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 posted their worst losses at the end of April with the former falling 2.4% while the latter fell 2.6%. Still, U.S.-listed stocks overall remain expensive and at risk of more volatility as a result.
This gets us to a stock like SoundHound AI. The company has seen its share price more than double since the start of the year. The company is trading at 23x forward sales, which is quite high for a sales multiple. Of course, because the company is not yet profitable, so the EBITDA and price-to-earnings multiples are out of whack already.
Fears of higher for longer interest rates will continue playing a major role in market volatility. That potentially jeopardizes current SOUN shareholders.

2024-05-07,3 Sinking Stocks to Quickly Abandon Now,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
It has been a few volatile weeks for U.S. equities. After ending the first quarter of 2024 with significant gains, the S&P500 and Nasdaq posted some of their worst months in a while in April. These major indices fell 2.63% and 2.42%, respectively. This dip has led to investors reevaluating their portfolios to consider if there are any stocks they will want to sell now.
Macroeconomic environment and the structural conditions within the market continue to make certain stocks untenable investments in the near and medium-terms. For one, trading multiples of U.S. equities in general are still pretty frothy. The macroeconomic data in coming weeks could still point to higher-than-expected inflation, placing bets on near-term Federal Reserve rate cuts further in doubt. Moreover, the U.S economy appears to be slowing based on recent Q1 data.
With that said, below are three sinking stocks to sell now as the market remains volatile.
SentinelOne (S)

The cybersecurity space has been some of the most afflicted in terms of broader macroeconomic machinations. While many enterprises have moved a lot of data and services to the cloud, these same businesses have, in turn, demanded a holistic approach to cybersecurity. Cybersecurity stocks posted amazing returns in 2020 and 2021 for this very reason. The macroeconomic environment, unfortunately, has made enterprises to think twice about allocating costs to the implementation of new cloud security software.
This is where SentinelOne (NYSE: S ) comes in. The cybersecurity firm’s “Singularity Extended Detection and Response Platform” leverages artificial intelligence to power cybersecurity solutions for an enterprise’s cloud network. Unfortunately, macroeconomic uncertainty has created headwinds for SentinelOne’s top-line growth, which slowed dramatically from triple-digit growth in 2021 and 2022 to mid-double-digit growth in 2023.
SentinelOne’s share price has fallen 16% on a year-to-date basis. Increased competition from dominant cybersecurity player CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD ) could lead to further losses.
Tesla (TSLA)
Source: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com
Recent news of Elon Musk’s trip to China and subsequent tentative approval of the Tesla’s (NASDAQ: TSLA ) autonomous system caused the electric vehicle (EV) maker’s shares to rally 15% on April 29. Ultimately, Tesla will be able to improve operating margins a few percentage points, which is the implication that sparked the rally. However, waning demand in the global EV market still spells trouble for Tesla in the medium and long-term.
Elevated interest rates have created a waning demand environment for new vehicles, combustion engine and electric. First quarter Tesla earnings results missed revenue, gross margin, and profit estimates , underscoring the difficulty of the automotive selling environment.
Tesla shares have fallen 25% on a year-to-date basis. Once investors refocus on the downward spiraling EV market environment, TSLA shares could receive even more pressure. And, solidifying Tesla’s position as one of the stocks investors will want to sell now.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com
iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) recently released its Q2 2024 earnings . And, despite various data points showing Apple’s decline in China, the tech giant remained optimistic on its long-term outlook. This optimism coupled with the largest share buyback program in the company’s history, $110 billion, sent shares soaring.
Let’s first tackle the shareholder buyback point. When a company repurchases shares from shareholders, it’s usually at a premium to the current stock price and investors are satisfied. However, it’s important to note while these buybacks are great for large shareholders, benefits for smaller shareholders are minimal in comparison. In other words, retail investors may get a short-term boost in the value of their investment once a share buyback program is announced, but a lot of the gains are going to go to the big fish.
The market’s positive reaction to Apple’s earnings announcement is also puzzling for other reasons. Apple’s top-line figures still declined 4% on a year-over-year basis with iPhone sales falling 10%. The optimism that Apple’s management announced doesn’t seem grounded in the reality of the data coming out of China these days. As Bloomberg points out in an article , a number of independent industry research do not point to anything optimistic.
Huawei’s continued rise will create additional headwinds for the iPhone maker. It just seems CEO Tim Cook’s optimism should be taken with a grain of salt and nothing more.

2024-05-06,4 most active stocks on Dow Jones after US Fed kept interest rates unchanged,"U.S. Federal Reserve left its benchmark overnight borrowing rate unchanged but kept hopes of rate cuts in the coming months alive on May 1 st ( read more ). Here are the three most active stocks on Dow Jones since the central bank’s announcement.
Chevron Corp (NYSE: CVX)
Chevron has been an active Dow Jones stock since the Fed’s announcement because the energy giant relies on debt financing for capital expenditures.
Plus, it pays a healthy dividend yield of just over 4.0% at writing which will turn all the more attractive for investors once the U.S. central bank begins to cut interest rates.
Lower rates also tend to spur economic activity that typically delivers a boost to oil demand and by extension revenue of an energy giant like Chevron.
$CVX trading volume sits at 8.427 million at writing.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL)
Apple is being actively traded since the Fed’s rate decision this month since it’s a tech behemoth that invests rather aggressively in pursuit of growth.
And the cost of borrowing money to make those investments will cut significantly once the interest rates start to move lower.
$AAPL, however, has been in focus recently also because it reported its financial results for the second quarter on May 2 nd ( find out more ).
Trading volume of Apple Inc is at 76.481 million at writing and the stock is up roughly 7.0% since the start of this month.
Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS)
Disney has been among the most active stocks on Dow Jones after U.S. Fed kept interest rates unchanged last week.
That’s partly because accelerated consumer spending typically follows rate cuts which could be a benefit for the mass media and entertainment conglomerate.
$DIS is scheduled to report its financial results for the second quarter on May 7th. Consensus is for it to earn $1.11 per share versus 93 cents a share last year.
Ahead of the earnings report, Disney stock ended today with trading volume 16.198 million. It’s up close to 30% versus its year-to-date low at writing.

2024-05-06,7 Stocks to Buy to Satisfy Your IRA Limits in 2024,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
2023 tax season has come and gone meaning it is time to consider 2024 contributions to your IRA. That will include some mix of Index and mutual funds, ETFs, bonds, and individual stocks. The maximum contribution in 2024 is $7,000 for those under 50 years of age and $8,000 for those 50 and older.
While most investors will be primarily mixing funds and bonds many will also be picking individual stocks to add to their IRAs. How much money an investor dedicates to individual stocks within an IRA is largely a function of risk tolerance. Generally speaking, the higher that contribution, the more risk and reward it entails.
That said, let’s look at some of the better individual stocks to choose when considering IRA contribution limits in 2024.
Microsoft (MSFT)
Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com
Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) stock is going to be one of the most popular large cap choices in an individual IRA in 2024. Many investors will have exposure to Microsoft through various index funds and ETFs. However, here we’re advocating for purchasing MSFT shares on an individual basis as part of an individual retirement account.
Frankly, investing in Microsoft should be an easy choice. Analysts recommend purchasing Microsoft on a near unanimous basis . It’s generally expected that the value of those shares should rise by between 20% in a base case scenario and by as much as 50% should things rapidly improve.
There’s plenty of reason to believe in that best case scenario when one looks at the firm’s most recent earnings report from April 25 . Revenues grew by 17% and net income increased by 20%. Thus, it’s entirely logical to believe that the value of the stock will rise by 20% moving forward. I like Microsoft because its AI fueled Cloud growth is a particular bright spot. Otherwise, investors should continue to consider Microsoft for its blend of growth and scale that has rarely been rivaled in the past.
Realty Income (O)
Source: Shutterstock
Realty Income (NYSE: O ) represents an excellent individual stock choice within an IRA, especially for income-oriented investors. Each share includes a dividend yielding 5.6% paid as a monthly dividend. The beauty of a monthly dividend is that it includes three times as many distributions meaning greater opportunities to compound gains.
Realty Income is also well-positioned defensively. Although the company is very retail oriented, it is highly recession resistant . The vast majority of its tenants operate in recession resistant sectors. That generally includes grocery stores, dollar stores, drugstores and other retail categories that tend to be non-cyclical in nature.
The other thing to note about Realty Income is the structure of the leases it signs with its tenants. They tend to be longer, usually on the order of 10 years. Further, the triple net agreements place many of the cost responsibilities on the tenants themselves. That leaves more money for investors and shareholders in the end.
Coca-Cola (KO)
Source: BORIMAT PRAOKAEW / Shutterstock.com
Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ) will continue to show up on lists and articles discussing the best stocks to invest in. Whether it’s related to Warren Buffett or defensive positioning and anticipation of a weakening economy, Coca-Cola is generally well regarded.
It’s that ladder notion – a potential economic weakening – that bears discussion.  A lot of the issue centers around the ongoing fight against inflation. The Federal Reserve has not had as much success in the last few months as it would have liked. That leads some to believe that inflation will be much more persistent than initially believed.
I believe Coca-Cola is uniquely positioned to benefit from that ongoing issue. First of all, Coca-Cola is one of the best defensive stocks there is. It tends to weather economic downturns better than the vast majority of the stock market. Further, consumers continue to buy Coca-Cola products despite higher prices brought on by inflation . In fact, the company raised its guidance for 2024 due to that fact. If inflation will indeed continue to prove more sticky than initially believed, Coca-Cola looks uniquely positioned to thrive regardless.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) continues to deal with a period of stagnation and slowing sales. The news there isn’t all bad by any means. while Apple’s sales and earnings did decline on a year-over-year basis, each also bested guidance .
Apple decided to placate investor worries by increasing its share buyback program while simultaneously increasing its dividend by 4%. So, Apple is trying to introduce greater share price stability via more conservative means. The market seems to have appreciated the efforts. However, that is not the only reason to buy Apple at the moment.
The company remains tight-lipped about its AI plans. CEO Tim Cook is likely to divulge the details about Apple’s AI future at the firm’s Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in June.
The best time to have invested in Apple would have been a few days ago before the share buyback announcement. However, all is not lost. Apple’s shares are strengthening again as it appears dedicated to stability. That, along with the potential for a price spike in June suggest that investors should buy in the interim.
Amazon (AMZN)
Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com
It’s difficult not to like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) stock at the moment. Aside from the ever persistent threat of anti-monopoly litigation there’s very little to dislike. Amazon has largely avoided that threat for so long that it’s probably better to just ignore it wholesale. Instead, investors should focus on its earnings report and what it says about the company’s future.
Sales increased by 13%, rising to $143.3 billion. The company’s Cloud service – Amazon Web Services – continues to thrive. As good as those numbers are, the focus is really all about artificial intelligence.
The company announced a generative AI based assistant intended to speed software development. That AI assistant should be particularly powerful from the perspective that it leverages Amazon’s AWS cloud. The company concurrently announced Bedrock , a fully managed AI service for quickly building and launching applications.
Those developments –  along with strong results – suggest that Amazon is an excellent individual stock choice in any IRA.
Nvidia (NVDA)
Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) stock continues to face a bevy of headwinds that have pulled its share prices lower by about 15%. Those headwinds include news that its Blackwell chips might ship later than initially anticipated, disappointing guidance from rival AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ), and ongoing concerns regarding when in 2024, if at all, rate cuts will occur.
Buy it anyway because it is one of the best individual stocks to have in your IRA or otherwise. The simple fact remains that until another firm produces better AI chips than Nvidia does, there’s no reason to doubt the company over the mid and long-term. The artificial intelligence boom continues to be the greatest opportunity for investors of this generation.
Nvidia dominates demand for the chips that power the AI boom. However, Nvidia’s strengths extend beyond chips alone when it comes to AI. The company is rapidly moving into the artificial intelligence fueled humanoid robots sector. The Project GR00T foundational model is going to be an interesting theme to follow. Nvidia has clearly affected the data center space and may ultimately disrupt the entire economy down to the factory floor.
American Express (AXP)
Source: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com
American Express (NYSE: AXP ) is arguably the best choice of the top three credit card stocks. Actually, if you follow the returns it’s inarguable that it’s the best. American Express has outperformed Visa (NYSE: V ) and MasterCard (NYSE: MA ) in 2023. That outperformance spans back more than 5 years and suggests that American Express will continue to outperform its rivals.
That logically begs the question of why American Express has been able to outperform other credit card stocks. My theory is that it relates to credit worthiness. American Express serves a higher income consumer base which is more credit-worthy. The risk of non-payments and defaults is much lower and as a result AXP shares simply outperform.
Frankly speaking, any of the major three credit card stocks are good choices for the purpose of an IRA investment: each is relatively stable and well exposed to fintech growth opportunities. However, for all of the reasons I just discussed, American Express stands head and shoulders above the other two.

Apple ( AAPL ) finds itself amidst intense debates after over a year and a half of lagging performance compared to both other big tech giants and the broader S&P 500 Index ( SPY ). This prolonged underperformance has led many investors to question AAPL's longstanding position as an untouchable leader in the tech industry. As skepticism mounts, discussions regarding AAPL's future trajectory have intensified, with divergent opinions emerging.
Some investors maintain a strong confidence in AAPL's resilience, citing its formidable market position and robust ecosystem. However, others argue that the company may be vulnerable to disruption from established and emerging competitors. Additionally, there is speculation that AAPL's current weaknesses could create opportunities for new entrants with innovative products to challenge its dominance. ...",10

2024-05-06,Stocks to Sell: 3 Wall Street Darlings About to Become Investor Nightmares,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Recent first-quarter earnings reports have underlined the level of uncertainty surrounding tech stocks at a time when confounding Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) inflation figures have had an adverse impact on Wall Street.
The news of March inflation data being hotter than expected at 3.5% caused widespread concern across U.S. markets. And the prospect of multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts arriving in 2024 are diminishing as a result.
Markets had largely priced in rate cuts arriving as early as March 2024 earlier this year. So, it’s unsurprising that the S&P 500 fell nearly 4% in April off the back of bad news.
Also, this poses fresh challenges for some key members of Wall Street’s Magnificent Seven. These tech stocks have been major beneficiaries of positive market sentiment. Now, as optimism recedes, we’re seeing more frailties emerge. As a result, these three U.S. bets could be moving into sell territory.
Apple (AAPL)

With a market capitalization of over $2.5 trillion, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has long enjoyed an extensive market share. They’ve had higher profit margins due to the company’s commitment to innovation and high-spec technology.
However, storm clouds appear to be circling for the Wall Street giant. In January, the stock was downgraded by Barclays . This was due to weaker performance in China and a lack of iPhone innovation in recent years.
The stock has since declined more than 8% since the beginning of the year. And, the recent news that Q1 sales in China, the world’s biggest market, have fallen 20% as the same period last year, likely raises concern.
In addition, rival smartphone firm Huawei’s profits have recently risen six-fold . It seems the company found a way to eat into Apple’s market share despite Western sanctions.
All of this has left Apple looking for new opportunities to out-innovate rivals. True, the launch of the Vision Pro has opened the company up to a new market. But Apple’s slower adoption of generative artificial intelligence ( AI ) hurt the short-term recovery of the stock.
As a result, AAPL’s mounting challenges could ultimately damage the stock’s status as a Wall Street darling. Thus, the company must find a fresh avenue for tangible innovation.
Tesla (TSLA)
Source: kovop / Shutterstock.com
Another stock that’s struggling for momentum in 2024 is Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ). The company has already endured a downgrade from Phillip Securities in Q2 from neutral to reduce. It suffers a lowly price target of $145 due to slower electric vehicle ( EV ) deliveries and pricing pressures.
Also, TSLA fell over 25% this year, with first-quarter adjusted profit down 48% and revenue declining 9% compared to Q1 of 2023.
With a price war raging among EV manufacturers in China, there’s a danger that Tesla will become collateral damage. Firms are bidding to secure higher sales volumes throughout global markets.
Then, of course, we can’t overlook the tumultuous leadership of Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) Elon Musk. Recently, he fired Tesla’s entire team of 500 employees behind the firm’s supercharger network. However, it’s important to note that Musk’s idiosyncratic approach to managing the company has contributed to its recent struggles as well as its impressive rally toward becoming one of Wall Street’s most valuable stocks.
Additionally, it’s a testament to Musk’s leadership that the stock has recently experienced some growth. That followed a reported deal to roll out Tesla’s self-driving technology in China. It was described as a “watershed moment” by Wedbush analyst Dan Ives .
Thus, Tesla is a largely unpredictable stock at this moment in time, and for risk-averse investors, it is certainly a sell as the company tries to stop its long-term slide.
Meta Platforms (META)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
Unlike the other stocks, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) is enjoying a strong start to 2024, growing more than 40% in the first quarter alone. However, the tech giant may face future problems stemming from its significant bet on the AI boom.
Notably, AI and generative AI in particular have been big business over the past year. Meta Platforms raised its outlook for total expenses for 2024 to $96-$99 billion which represent a major outlay.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been a longtime cheerleader for AI. And while the company has managed to grow alongside the wider generative AI boom, the industry has remained largely speculative. Therefore, Meta’s heavy spending could represent a gamble for the company if other revenue streams decline.
The firm has experienced slower ad sales to Chinese advertisers , which was previously responsible for five percentage points of Meta’s growth in 2023. This points to a possible struggle to sustain momentum should its AI investments fail to pay off in the long-term.

Yet, it’s not fair to pigeonhole Baidu in this way. For example, Baidu launched the first 24/7 robo-taxi service in China. Also, Baidu is an important AI-technology develop.
In fact, per The Wall Street Journal , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) “ held preliminary talks with” Baidu about the possibility of using Baidu’s generative-AI technology in Apple’s devices in China.
Furthermore, Baidu recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Nissan Motor (OTCMKTS: NSANY ) to conduct research on AI and “smart cars.” Not only that, but the agreement calls for Nissan to “equip its Chinese cars with Baidu’s AI products,” Reuters reported.
Baidu’s AI Chatbot Achieves a Milestone
Clearly, Baidu is making its presence known as an AI-tech contender. Investors should keep an eye out for more partnerships, as the Baidu-Nissan MOU might only be the start of an ongoing trend.
Additionally, Baidu is quickly staking its claim as a gen-AI juggernaut in the company’s home country. U.S.-based stock traders might not be aware of this, but Baidu’s ERNIE Bot gen-AI chatbot is gaining serious traction in China.
Recently, Baidu achieves a major milestone when its ERNIE Bot “amassed 200 million users .” That’s what I would call ultra-rapid growth, as ERNIE Bot debuted on March 16, 2023.
This is a perfect example of why U.S. investors should broaden their horizons. ERNIE Bot has a huge presence in China, just like ChatGPT does in America.
Thus, investigating investment opportunities abroad can alert you to new and interesting stock ideas.
Baidu Stock: Grab This While It’s Still Cheap
Are you seeking prime gen-AI exposure in your portfolio, but at a great price? Look no further.
Baidu’s GAAP trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is 12.94x , versus the sector median P/E ratio of 18.98x. Hence, there’s a terrific bargain that’s ripe for the picking.
It’s a shame that some American investors won’t take advantage of this. Maybe they’ve unfairly pigeonholed Baidu or they’re just not aware of the company.
So, feel free to grab some Baidu stock shares while they’re still cheap, as they’ll probably be much more expensive in a year or two.

Does the company’s buyback announcement portend a lack of reinvestment opportunities for the core business? Probably not.
However, Apple's AI announcement this coming week has to get the attention of the Street.
Will AI's capex surge reduce technology stock valuations? The mega cap 7 or mega cap 10 stocks could trade listlessly for a few quarters as the true ""capex"" is worked out.
Capex: FASB - the Financial Accounting Standards Board - defines “capex” as “the investment required to sustain the economics of a business”. Capex is not an expense, i.e., a deduction from revenue, but rather is a “capitalized” item that shows up on the statement of cash flow in the “investing” section, and before the 1980s services economy exploded, was traditionally “payments for property, plant and equipment” that weren’t expensed, but capitalized, and then depreciated over the useful life of an asset.

2024-05-06,Where Will Apple Stock Be in 1 Year?,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) posted its latest earnings report on May 2. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on March 31), the tech giant's revenue fell 4% year over year to $90.8 billion but exceeded analysts' estimates by $190 million. Net income dipped 2% to $23.6 billion, but the company's $43.3 billion in buybacks boosted its diluted EPS by a penny to $1.53 and cleared the consensus forecast by $0.03.
Apple's growth rates were anemic, but it boosted its quarterly dividend by 4% to $0.25 a share, which translates to a forward yield of 0.5%; and authorized a new $110 billion buyback plan, which is equivalent to 4% of its market cap.

2024-05-06,Time to Sell These 3 Under-Performing Stocks Based on Their Bad Decisions,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Sometimes great companies fail to respond effectively to huge, new threats because they’re stuck in a rut and become stocks to sell. The classic example of this phenomenon is Blockbuster’s failure to acquire Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) when it had a golden opportunity to easily do so. For the readers who are too young to remember Blockbuster and haven’t heard about it, the company relied on renting DVDs through brick-and-mortar stores. In 2000, money-losing Netflix was renting DVDs through the mail and, I believe, had the vision of one day streaming movies. In that year, Netflix offered to sell itself to Blockbuster for just $50 million, and Blockbuster refused the offer.
Obviously, Blockbuster’s decision to simply stay the course in the face of huge technological changes proved to be disastrous. The chain subsequently declared bankruptcy and ceased to exist. Here are three contemporary firms that, like Blockbuster, are failing to react effectively to gigantic, looming problems. As a result, I view these names as stocks to sell.
Starbucks (SBUX)
Source: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com
Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) is facing huge competition in China and the U.S. from coffee brands Luckin Coffee (OTCMKTS: LKNCY ) and Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS ). I believe that the key factor behind Starbucks’ recently reported disastrous fiscal second-quarter results was the tough competition from these two rapidly growing firms.
In my opinion, Starbucks made a crucial error by failing to acquire Luckin and/or Dutch Bros when they were trading at much lower levels. If Starbucks had offered to buy them in 2022, for example, the coffee giant could have obtained them for a relatively small sum.
As long as Dutch Bros and Luckin continue to expand and gain market share, I believe that Starbucks will be, at best, “dead money” going forward. Consequently, it’s definitely among stocks to sell.
Walt Disney (DIS)
Source: chrisdorney / Shutterstock
For many years, I’ve believed that Walt Disney’s (NYSE: DIS ) two largest businesses, cable TV channels and movies, were going to shrink dramatically. And, so far, my thesis has certainly proven to be accurate. Cord cutting is continuously reducing cable subscriber totals and Americans are visiting movie theaters much less than they once did. There is also significant competition in the streaming sector. As a result, I thought that Disney’s streaming services would not be a good way to compensate for the declining profits of its cable channel and movie businesses. The latter theory has also proved to be on target, as the conglomerate’s streaming channels still aren’t profitable.
Disney’s decision to put so many of its eggs in the streaming basket was certainly erroneous, as was its decision to spend a huge $71.3 billion on buying 21st Century Fox. By that year, Disney should have seen that its movie and cable assets were headed for big problems.
Instead, Disney should have doubled down on its highly successful parks business by building and/or acquiring parks in additional countries. Buying an online sports betting company company and trying to promote it through ESPN also would have made sense.
The conglomerate very belatedly took a tentative step in that direction by launching a sports-betting partnership with Penn Entertainment (NASDAQ: PENN ) last year. But Disney is not going to directly obtain revenue from the deal. Moreover, the companies’ venture, called, ESPN Bet has a huge disadvantage because it was launched so many years after other companies in the space had already acquired a high number of customers.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com
Last quarter, Apple’s top line dropped a dismal 4.3% versus the same period a year earlier to $90.75 billion. Even more importantly, last quarter was the fifth out of the last six quarters that the storied company’s revenue has fallen. Moreover, the sales generated by the tech giant’s flagship products tumbled a huge 10.5% YOY last quarter.
The firm is supposed to enhance the iPhone with AI capabilities later this year. But, given the company’s inability under CEO Tim Cook to introduce truly needle-moving product initiatives, I don’t expect the changes to boost the iPhone’s sales significantly, let alone meaningfully increase the company’s overall top line.
Apple could have and should have acquired Roku (NASDDAQ: ROKU ). If the tech giant had advertised Apple TV on the platform, its streaming initiative would have become a big success. And it would have been able to tout its many other products on Roku, which could have significantly lifted sales of these other offerings.

2024-05-13,Now Even Apple Wants to Make Data Center Chips! Which Are the 3 Best Chipmaker Stocks to Buy?,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is best known for its consumer electronic products that develop a cult-like following. In fact, the tech stock is a formidable chipmaker. The very first in-house chip appeared in the iPhone 4 way back in 2010. Yet today, all Apple computers run on their own processors.
Apple’s chips are for its own consumption though. They don’t sell them to others. And because it relies upon its own designs, it is no longer beholden to other chipmakers for supply. Now Apple isn’t a foundry. It doesn’t physically make its own processors. As so many others do, it turns that function over to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM ).
But currently, Apple is looking to expand. A recent report in The Wall Street Journal said the tech giant was developing its own chips that are designed to run artificial intelligence ( AI ) software in data center servers.
Apple Chips in Data Centers are codenamed ACDC. These processors will target AI inference rather than AI training. The difference between them is with training, the processors develop and refine AI algorithms while inference, take already-trained AI algorithms to use real-world data.
Apple isn’t alone. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) are developing custom inference chips to minimize reliance on third-party chipmakers. But with the field growing more crowded which are the best chipmaker stocks to buy? The three companies below easily make the cut.
Nvidia (NVDA)
Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com
There is no question Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) has to top the list. Its graphics processing units ( GPU ) dominate right now with a 98% share of the data center market , according to Wells Fargo. Although that is expected to drop to between 94% and 96% as rivals bring their own processors to market, Nvidia will still be the industry leader.
Nvidia’s GPUs target the training side of the equation. Its original Tesla and Ampere GPUs were designed to tackle the vast computational challenges AI presented. Its next-generation Hopper GPUs took it to the next level. Those had an ability to deliver sixfold more performance than the Ampere chips. The H100 chips are still seen as the foundational base that other chipmakers aspire to teach AI models. Now the latest iteration is the GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip which triples the bandwidth the H100 offered.
But, it is much more expensive, so adoption may not be as quick. For unparalleled power, hyperscalers may choose the GH200. Yet it opens up a wedge for competitors to offer lower cost chips that can more than get the job done. Still, Nvidia remains the premiere AI chipmaker stock to buy.
Arm Holdings (ARM)
Source: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com
British chip stock Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM ) is not exactly a chipmaker. Rather it develops a chip architecture and a set of instructions that it licenses to customers. Apple’s chips are all ARM processors. The two signed an agreement last year that is extends through 2040 and beyond .
Apple and Arm’s other clients include Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). These companies pay royalties to Arm Holdings on each unit shipped.
ARM’s low power needs have made the chips exceptionally popular with mobile handset manufacturers. Also, it made them in demand for data centers, where energy consumption is increasingly a concern . The large language model chips from Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon all run on Arm’s newest V9 technology. While the primary functions of data centers are performed by GPUs, Arm Holdings chips will run alongside them. So, they will benefit from the growth AI is creating in data center demand.
Indeed, because of Nvidia’s data cen ter dominance, you could see ARM become an integral part of data center architecture. Nvidia’s latest, most advanced chip Grace Blackwell Superchip integrates the chipmaker’s GPUs with Arm Holding’s central processing units ( CPUs ). ARM Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) Rene Haas told analysts , “I think now with Nvidia’s most recent announcement, Grace Blackwell, you are going to see an acceleration of ARM of the data center in these AI applications.”
Since Arm Holdings works, well, arm-in-arm with these chipmakers it will be a top stock to buy .
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)
Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com
If Nvidia and other chipmakers are going to benefit from the rise of AI in data centers, then it’s clear the manufacturer they turn to to actually make the chips must be included as well. As their business grows, so will Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.
As noted above, Apple isn’t making its own chips. TSM makes them. The same is true for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO ) and Qualcomm . TSM is the world’s largest chip foundry pureplay. Because of “insatiable” demand for AI chips, the company forecast sales will grow by low- to mid-20% rates this year with AI accounting for low-teen percentages of revenue.
Supply chain issues and capacity constraints have actually held the chipmaker back over the past few years. However, it is building new factories to meet demand. But a second manufacturing plant in Arizona has been put on hold as rising costs and lack of skilled labor dent progress.
Still, TSM just reported a 60% year-over-year ( YOY ) surge in April sales that also grew 20% jump from March, indicating business is still strong. That makes Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing one of the best chipmaker stocks to buy.

An Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Store strike is coming to Towson, Maryland as members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Coalition of Organized Retail Employees (IAM CORE) voted in favor of the strike .
This strike comes after the union employees have negotiated with Apple for over a year. The IAM CORE members decided on the strike due to the “unsatisfactory outcomes” of these negotiations.
Here’s what the IAM CORE Negotiating Committee said about the Apple Store strike:
“The passage of the strike sanction vote highlights IAM CORE’s unwavering commitment to advocating for the rights and well-being of workers in the face of challenges. As discussions with Apple management continue, we remain committed to securing tangible improvements that benefit all employees.”
Timing of the Apple Store Strike
It’s still not been decided when this Apple Store strike will take place. What is worth noting is that the Towson, Maryland location was the first Apple Store to unionize . Other stores have attempted to do so, but with less success.
This has resulted in conflict between Apple and some of its retail employees. That includes allegations that the tech giant has taken part in union-busting tactics to keep its workers from unionizing.

My previous bullish upgrade on QQQ in early October emphasized that QQQ seemed ""well-primed to restart the next leg in its uptrend continuation (valid since March 2023)."" As a result, bearish investors who failed to anticipate the market's astute positioning and bullish price action likely missed capitalizing on QQQ's significant surge....",1

I have prepared for the possibility of a sell-off by holding cash and hedging positions, but remain bullish in the long term.
The CPI is expected to be lower, what if it isn't?
If everyone expects this, no one is preparing for the other possibility. We see it in the VIX. The last time the VIX was this low was mid-December ‘23 it slowly rose into the first week of January where we saw a very steep sell-off. The technical explanation was that this was profit-taking in 2024 on 2023 gains. Stocks in 2023 performed so well that rather than year-end tax-loss selling in 2023 traders and investors held off so as not to pay the tax man in 2024. I won’t argue that point, I will say that complacency in the form of a lack of hedging exacerbated the selling. Another point is that with this level of complacency, something can easily come along and upset the “Apple Cart”. Complacency is not just apparent in the VIX, As we’ll see later on....",1
2024-05-13,Apple Music celebrates the greatest records ever made with the launch of inaugural 100 Best Albums list,"A 10-day countdown kicks off today with the reveal of albums 100-91, featuring works from Solange; Tyler, The Creator; George Michael; and more
Discover, share, and follow along as Apple Music journeys through the albums that shaped, inspired, and fundamentally changed music
Apple Music® today announced the release of its 100 Best Albums of all time, a celebratory list of the greatest records ever made, crafted by Apple Music’s team of experts alongside a select group of artists, including Maren Morris, Pharrell Williams, J Balvin, Charli XCX, Mark Hoppus, Honey Dijon, and Nia Archives, as well as songwriters, producers, and industry professionals. The list is an editorial statement — fully independent of any streaming numbers on Apple Music, a love letter to the records that have shaped the world we live and listen in.
This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240513024769/en/
(Graphic: Apple Inc.)
Apple Music is bringing its 100 Best Albums to life with a countdown celebration beginning today, revealing 10 albums each day for the next 10 days, along with a brand-new 100 Best microsite, new and exclusive content, dedicated Apple Music radio episodes, and so much more. The countdown will culminate on the final day with the reveal of Apple Music’s top 10 albums of all time during a broadcast radio special.
“100 Best brings together all the things that make Apple Music the ultimate service for music lovers — human curation at its peak, an appreciation for the art of storytelling, and unparalleled knowledge of music and an even deeper love for it,” said Rachel Newman, Apple Music’s senior director of content and editorial. “We have been working on this for a very long time, and it’s something we are all incredibly proud of and excited to share with the world.”
“Putting this list together was a true labor of love, both in that it was incredibly difficult to do and in that we are all so passionate about it,” said Zane Lowe, Apple Music’s global creative director and lead anchor for Apple Music 1. “We were tasked with selecting the 100 best — that’s practically mission impossible. But as music fans, it was also amazing to really take a minute and sit and think about the music and albums and artists that we love so much in this context. If this list sparks more debate among fans outside of Apple Music and gets people talking passionately about the music they love, then we’ve done what we set out to do.”
The first 10 albums, revealed today, offer a glimpse into Apple Music’s unique approach with 100 Best. With seven of the 10 records hailing from the 21st century, two from the 90s, only one from the 70s, and various genres represented, the list spotlights contemporary artists like Tyler, The Creator; Robyn; Lorde; Travis Scott; Solange; Burial; and more who have helped define this century through their music and its influence on others.
100. Body Talk , Robyn
99. Hotel California, Eagles
98. ASTROWORLD, Travis Scott
97. Rage Against the Machine , Rage Against the Machine
96. Pure Heroine , Lorde
95 . Confessions , USHER
94. Untrue , Burial
93. A Seat at the Table , Solange
92. Flower Boy , Tyler, The Creator
91. Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1 , George Michael
“There are so many fun facts for our listeners to discover about these albums,” said Scott Plagenhoef, Apple Music’s global head of music programming. “For example, two of the records revealed today were promoted without the image of the artist, but for opposite reasons — Burial’s Untrue because the artist was still operating anonymously at the time, and George Michael’s Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1 because the artist was actually retreating from fame.”
Discover, Learn, and Share with Friends
To accompany the list, today Apple Music also revealed a dedicated microsite that will update every day of the countdown, making it easy for listeners to follow along. Available now at 100best.music.apple.com , the new 100 Best microsite spotlights in-depth analysis of each album, archival interviews, and more, and makes it easy for fans to share their favorite albums with friends and on their social channels.
Explore records 100-91 of Apple Music’s 100 Best Albums at 100best.music.apple.com .
Follow Along on Apple Music Radio
Fans will also be treated to a full 100 Best Albums Radio takeover on Apple Music Hits, broadcasting round-the-clock specials with Apple Music Radio hosts, daily specials at 9 a.m. PT (noon ET), plus exclusive content dropping every day on demand on Apple Music and Apple Podcasts.
The last 10 albums will be revealed on Wednesday, May 22, with a special roundtable discussion broadcasting globally on Apple Music that features guest artists Nile Rodgers and Maggie Rogers reflecting on the list alongside Apple Music’s own Zane Lowe and Ebro Darden. Lowe will also curate a special mashup-style DJ mix featuring songs from all 100 Best Albums.
Apple Music will keep the momentum going after the countdown ends with an additional week of 100 Best Albums Radio takeover on Apple Music Hits.
All 100 Best Album recipients will be given an award comprised of blasted anodized aluminum, sourced entirely from recycled Apple products, in a unique polished PVD gold. The design on the back of the award takes its cues from a vinyl LP record and is inscribed with the artist’s name, album’s title, and album’s year of release.

The "" Magnificent Seven "" stock's robust rally can be attributed to the growing prominence of its high-margin services business, as well as a tremendous smartphone upgrade cycle triggered by the arrival of 5G smartphones.
However, Apple stock has lost its luster in 2024. It is down nearly 5%, and has underperformed the S&P 500 so far.
Berkshire Hathaway , led by celebrated investor Warren Buffett, has reduced its Apple stake by 13%.

Three of the best blue chip stocks to buy, whether you're a seasoned investor or new to Wall Street, are Walmart (NYSE: WMT) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , and Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) . Here's a closer look at these stocks to see why they can make for solid investments in the long run.

For example, Apple, including dividend payments, has climbed more than 900% over the past decade.
In recent times, though, declining demand from China has weighed on earnings growth, and investors have seen Apple as slower than other tech companies to invest in the high-growth area of artificial intelligence (AI). As a result, the tech giant's shares have lagged behind; this year, they've hardly changed so far.
Still, Apple over time has proven it's a growth company you can count on, and a top buy during bull markets and beyond. So could this bull market buy help you become a millionaire in the coming years as it's done for others in the past? Let's find out.",1

PDD Holdings' previous earnings release beat expectations, but the stock still crashed. The trading after today's release was lukewarm.
Some factors in PDD Holdings' release, such as cash flows, suggest that the company's earnings quality and sustainability might not be great.
In this article, I explore why I remain bullish on PDD Holdings ahead of earnings, and why I am downgrading my rating to ""buy"" despite my continued bullishness.
PDD Holdings Inc. ( PDD ) just released its earnings for the first quarter. The release showed a 131% increase in revenue and a 202% increase in adjusted EPS. Both figures exceeded analysts' expectations by wide margins. The EPS growth in particular was nearly double what analysts expected. The stock, however, achieved just minor gains after the release came out. As I will show in a later paragraph, the tepid reaction to all of this explosive growth was not necessarily irrational, as there was plausible cause to question the earnings figure reported....",1

2024-05-22,3 Chip Stocks to Buy to Invest in AI's Brain,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Shares in global chipmakers have continued to move higher presenting some compelling chip stocks to buy. This is amid a more favorable macro backdrop and unprecedented demand for high-end chips that power artificial intelligence ( AI ) apps. The investment appeal of these stocks received a notable boost after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM ), the world’s largest chip manufacturing company, reported April revenue up nearly 60% from the same period last year.
This marks the most substantial growth rate for the year 2024 thus far. TSMC is a crucial supplier for tech giants such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ). It has a strong performance signaling anticipated growth in customer operations.
Chip stocks maintain a favorable outlook on the risk-reward potential for global semiconductor stocks . Here, we look at three chip stocks to buy that are considered safe bets in the chipmaking sector.
Broadcom (AVGO)

Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO ) is a leading global technology company and one of the top chip stocks to buy. The company designs, develops and supplies various semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. Known for its extensive product portfolio, Broadcom’s offerings encompass data center networking, broadband access, software, and wireless connectivity.
Most recently, Barclays initiated coverage on Broadcom with a positive outlook, assigning an Overweight rating and a price target of $1,405. The brokerage firm highlighted that Broadcom is leading in the data center silicon market and poised to benefit from the burgeoning advancements in artificial intelligence ( AI ).
Broadcom’s inclusion in Barclays’ list of preferred names for the year stems from its robust data center silicon portfolio. Despite the semiconductor industry’s susceptibility to cyclical downturns, the company’s growing software business is recognized as a pivotal element in bolstering profitability and free cash flow.
Barclays’ attention to AI’s potential is timely. The firm anticipates a mid to high-20% growth rate for Broadcom next year. This surge will continue over the long haul, fueled by the company’s expertise in custom silicon and switching solutions.
Micron (MU)

Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU ) is a leading global innovative memory and storage solutions provider. Micron’s product portfolio includes DRAM, NAND flash memory and NOR flash memory, integral to advanced computing, mobile applications and data centers.
The company’s stock has surged on robust demand for high bandwidth memory this year. Micron is the supplier of these chips, alongside Samsung Electronics ( OTC:SSNLF ) and SK Hynix’s ( OTC:HXSCL ). Along these lines, Baird analysts recently upgraded their rating on Micron stock.
The brokerage firm cited significant growth opportunities for the company in the face of increasing demand for AI applications. The firm changed its rating from Neutral to Outperform. It’s anticipating substantial upside potential for the United States’ largest memory chip manufacturer.
The upgrade comes after Baird analysts researched the semiconductor industry, identifying positive trends in the Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) market that could benefit Micron. According to Baird, recent checks within the channel have revealed an outlook for memory that could be favorable over the next 12 to 18 months.
Additionally, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) has recognized the strong performance and market position of Micron. It has upgraded its rating from “Underweight” to “Equalweight” and substantially increased its price target from $98 to $130 — an increase of over 32% .
Baird’s report highlighted that DRAM prices surpass expectations, which could lead to constrained industry-wide supply growth. They expect the growth to slow to low single digits quarter-over-quarter in the latter half of 2024.
This slowdown is partly due to capacity shifts toward high-bandwidth memory ( HBM ). It is expected to enter a new supercycle that could significantly enhance Micron’s gross margins. The investment firm pointed out Micron’s production of HBM3E , the latest generation of high-bandwidth memory. It has the potential to achieve over 60% gross margin.
Super Micro Computer (SMCI)

Super Micro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ: SMCI ), known as Supermicro, is a global leader in high-performance, high-efficiency server technology and innovation. The company provides advanced server solutions, storage systems, and cloud computing technologies.
Wall Street analysts recently highlighted SMCI as one of the top chip stocks to buy, describing the stock as the “Switzerland of AI ” following the company’s announcement of another set of strong quarterly results. Rosenblatt analysts, known for their expertise on chip stocks, pointed out that the company’s AI dynamics are “a sweet spot for the company’s building block architecture, Green computing, rapid broad platform deployment, and must-have liquid cooling capabilities.“
Similarly, analysts at Loop Capital reiterated their Buy rating on shares of Super Micro Computer, maintaining a price target of $1,500. The firm anchors its positive stance on the stock in Super Micro’s well-positioned AI dynamics, driven by the company’s building block architecture.

Beaten-down Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB ) stock is trading at $143 today and has lost 8% value in the past month. The company has been under pressure after the first-quarter results since investors weren’t happy with the guidance.
Airbnb had the best Q1 ever with 133 million nights and experiences booked. It reported an 18% year-over-year ( YOY ) jump in revenue to hit $2.1 billion. The net income came in at $264 million, which is also its most profitable first quarter.
However, the market only paid attention to the guideline for the second quarter which shadowed the impressive numbers. The management is aiming for a 9% revenue growth in Q2 to hit $2.7 billion, lower than the growth achieved in the first quarter and below estimates. Since Airbnb operates an asset-light model, it has the potential to gain financial strength with each profitable quarter.
I believe Airbnb is a solid long-term play and am impressed at the company’s bounce-back post pandemic. The summer travel could lead to better-than-expected results for the company.
ABNB gives strong competition to hotels and is using technology to enhance user experience. I think the market reaction is overdone, and the recent dip in the stock is a chance to accumulate.
Apple (AAPL)

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has had a poor start to 2024, and its price has only started to recover slowly. The company reported a drop in iPhone sales due to the economic downturn and also announced a massive buyback. Investors aren’t very convinced about the future of Apple. But I believe this is one company that can bounce back at any time.
Up 3% year-to-date ( YTD ), AAPL exchanges hands for $192 and is moving closer to the 52-week high of $199. If you can keep the drop in iPhone sales aside, Apple looks like a highly lucrative business with a powerful brand name. Its service segment is thriving and has outperformed other segments. In the recent quarter , it reported a 14% YOY revenue jump.
Moreover, Apple enjoys high brand loyalty and this has helped it expand across the world. Someone using an Apple product today might not easily switch to another brand. Yes, one cannot ignore the China problem , but I think Apple has the potential to handle this situation well.
Also, it has enough resources to keep innovating and offering the most technologically advanced products to consumers. Apple has announced the largest share repurchase in history and this move has worked in its favor. Additionally, it declared a 25-cent dividend for shareholders. Looking at the company’s growth story, the stock looks inexpensive at the current level and is a buy-and-hold.
Amazon (AMZN)

E-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is exchanging hands for $183 today and is up 23% YTD. The stock has seen a steady rise over the past 12 months, and it is not long before it hits $200.
The company reported a blowout quarter driven by the cloud segment and advertising revenue. With two of its fastest-growing segments, Amazon has become so much more than an e-commerce company.
It saw a 13% jump in sales to $143.3 billion. The cloud segment, Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) showed a 17% YOY revenue growth while the advertising segment was up 24% YOY. Notably, the net income reached $10.4 billion as compared to the net income of $3.2 billion in the same period the prior year.
Further, Amazon has a highly diversified business with multiple revenue sources which will continue driving growth. It started investing in artificial intelligence ( AI ) well in time to gain a higher market share with AWS. Thus, its investments have started to pay off. Finally, it also has enough cash flow to keep investing in the business.

2024-05-22,Monumental Funding Has Elon Musk AI Venture Primed For Takeoff,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Editor’s Note: This article was previously published under the title, “Learn How to Profit From Elon Musk’s $18 Billion AI Project” but has been updated to include the most recent information.
For years, one of the world’s richest men and arguably most influential tech visionary – Elon Musk – has mostly watched the AI Boom unfold from the sidelines.
That all changes now – quite literally any day.
That’s because just a few weeks ago, reports emerged suggesting that, any day now, Musk is set to secure up to $6 billion in funding for his new AI startup xAI.
Now, Musk founded xAI about a year ago. And to date, the company has done very little. Aside from launching its AI chatbot Grok – which many experts say matches up pound-for-pound with ChatGPT – things have been mostly quiet since xAI’s founding.
But this $6 billion funding round could change that in a dramatic way.
Of course, the thing about world-changing businesses is that they start with world-changing people. Those folks have revolutionary ideas. And when funded with billions of dollars, they turn those ideas into world-changing businesses.
After all, Apple ( AAPL ) only became what it is today thanks to Steve Jobs, who came up with the idea of the iPhone. Jobs then leveraged the enormous amount of money Apple was making off its computers to create the iPhone. And voila… Apple became a trillion-dollar company.
Similarly, Microsoft ( MSFT ) grew into a tech titan because of Bill Gates, who came up with the idea for Windows. Gates used the money Microsoft was making off its PCs to further develop Windows. And that allowed Microsoft to become a trillion-dollar company.
World-changing people with ample resources create world-changing businesses.
So… if you want to invest in world-changing businesses… start with the world-changing people gathering the resources necessary to bring their visions to life.
That is exactly the situation we have with Elon Musk and xAI today.
Invest in a World-Changer Like Elon Musk
We certainly believe that Elon Musk is a world-changer.
He co-founded PayPal ( PYPL ), the world’s largest digital payment platform, now worth nearly $70 billion…
And SpaceX , the world’s largest private space rocket firm, now worth about $180 billion.
He pioneered one of the world’s largest automakers in Tesla ( TSLA )…
And he’s also the man behind Neuralink , The Boring Company , and X .
Musk has influenced how we pay for things, what cars we drive, how we communicate online, how we see space…
I’d venture to say that he is one of the most influential business figures of the past 20 years.
A great example of world-changing.
And now this world-changing person has not only turned his focus to a new business venture at the heart of possibly the most transformative technology the world has ever seen. He’s also on the verge of reportedly acquiring $6 billion in funding to turn his AI vision into a reality.
Would you bet against him here – especially if he gets $6 billion next week to fund this operation?
I don’t think I would.
The Final Word
As we mentioned earlier, xAI has already launched its own impressive AI chatbot. And it did that with very little outside funding. Just imagine what Musk and company will be able to cook up with $6 billion in outside funding.
When all is said and done, xAI could be Elon Musk’s biggest venture yet – his signature mark on the world, if you will.
And right now, you have an opportunity to invest in xAI before this company takes off.
Now, it’s not a direct investment, per se. After all, xAI is barely a year old. It’s still a private startup, which means you can’t buy its stock anywhere.
But we have found a potentially huge “backdoor” investment into xAI. It’s a stock that you likely have never heard of before – but we think it could be the leading tech component supplier for this burgeoning AI titan.
If xAI does win the multi-trillion-dollar AI race… and Elon Musk does it again… then this stock could absolutely soar.
Get all the details about this potential future winner right now.

2024-05-22,Here's Why I Wouldn't Touch Apple Stock With a 10-Foot Pole,"For years, Apple 's (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock was a bedrock position in many people's portfolios. The company's growth, combined with the relative value of the stock, made it a no-brainer, and investors have been rewarded as a result. Over the past five years, Apple is up around 300% while the S&P 500 increased around 100%.
Any investor should be satisfied with this level of broader market outperformance, but those days may be over. The two factors (growth and value) that made Apple so compelling years ago no longer exist today. As a result, I wouldn't touch Apple stock with a 10-foot pole.
First, I'll tackle Apple's growth aspect. Apple's largest product line, the iPhone, has matured over the past decade. In earlier generations, each annual technological leap made it feasible to upgrade from year to year. This technological leap has narrowed, and consumers aren't as likely to upgrade as frequently. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended March 30), Apple's iPhone sales fell nearly 11% year over year.",1

2024-05-23,Could This Bull Market Buy Help You Become a Millionaire?,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has helped many investors become millionaires or at least generate a significant amount of wealth over the years.

For example, Apple, including dividend payments, has climbed more than 900% over the past decade.
In recent times, though, declining demand from China has weighed on earnings growth, and investors have seen Apple as slower than other tech companies to invest in the high-growth area of artificial intelligence (AI). As a result, the tech giant's shares have lagged behind; this year, they've hardly changed so far.
Still, Apple over time has proven it's a growth company you can count on, and a top buy during bull markets and beyond. So could this bull market buy help you become a millionaire in the coming years as it's done for others in the past? Let's find out.",2

PDD Holdings' previous earnings release beat expectations, but the stock still crashed. The trading after today's release was lukewarm.
Some factors in PDD Holdings' release, such as cash flows, suggest that the company's earnings quality and sustainability might not be great.
In this article, I explore why I remain bullish on PDD Holdings ahead of earnings, and why I am downgrading my rating to ""buy"" despite my continued bullishness.
PDD Holdings Inc. ( PDD ) just released its earnings for the first quarter. The release showed a 131% increase in revenue and a 202% increase in adjusted EPS. Both figures exceeded analysts' expectations by wide margins. The EPS growth in particular was nearly double what analysts expected. The stock, however, achieved just minor gains after the release came out.

2024-05-22,3 Chip Stocks to Buy to Invest in AI's Brain,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Shares in global chipmakers have continued to move higher presenting some compelling chip stocks to buy. This is amid a more favorable macro backdrop and unprecedented demand for high-end chips that power artificial intelligence ( AI ) apps. The investment appeal of these stocks received a notable boost after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM ), the world’s largest chip manufacturing company, reported April revenue up nearly 60% from the same period last year.
This marks the most substantial growth rate for the year 2024 thus far. TSMC is a crucial supplier for tech giants such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ). It has a strong performance signaling anticipated growth in customer operations.
Chip stocks maintain a favorable outlook on the risk-reward potential for global semiconductor stocks . Here, we look at three chip stocks to buy that are considered safe bets in the chipmaking sector.
Broadcom (AVGO)

Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO ) is a leading global technology company and one of the top chip stocks to buy. The company designs, develops and supplies various semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. Known for its extensive product portfolio, Broadcom’s offerings encompass data center networking, broadband access, software, and wireless connectivity.
Most recently, Barclays initiated coverage on Broadcom with a positive outlook, assigning an Overweight rating and a price target of $1,405. The brokerage firm highlighted that Broadcom is leading in the data center silicon market and poised to benefit from the burgeoning advancements in artificial intelligence ( AI ).
Broadcom’s inclusion in Barclays’ list of preferred names for the year stems from its robust data center silicon portfolio. Despite the semiconductor industry’s susceptibility to cyclical downturns, the company’s growing software business is recognized as a pivotal element in bolstering profitability and free cash flow.
Barclays’ attention to AI’s potential is timely. The firm anticipates a mid to high-20% growth rate for Broadcom next year. This surge will continue over the long haul, fueled by the company’s expertise in custom silicon and switching solutions.
Micron (MU)

Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU ) is a leading global innovative memory and storage solutions provider. Micron’s product portfolio includes DRAM, NAND flash memory and NOR flash memory, integral to advanced computing, mobile applications and data centers.
The company’s stock has surged on robust demand for high bandwidth memory this year. Micron is the supplier of these chips, alongside Samsung Electronics ( OTC:SSNLF ) and SK Hynix’s ( OTC:HXSCL ). Along these lines, Baird analysts recently upgraded their rating on Micron stock.
The brokerage firm cited significant growth opportunities for the company in the face of increasing demand for AI applications. The firm changed its rating from Neutral to Outperform. It’s anticipating substantial upside potential for the United States’ largest memory chip manufacturer.
The upgrade comes after Baird analysts researched the semiconductor industry, identifying positive trends in the Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) market that could benefit Micron. According to Baird, recent checks within the channel have revealed an outlook for memory that could be favorable over the next 12 to 18 months.
Additionally, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) has recognized the strong performance and market position of Micron. It has upgraded its rating from “Underweight” to “Equalweight” and substantially increased its price target from $98 to $130 — an increase of over 32% .
Baird’s report highlighted that DRAM prices surpass expectations, which could lead to constrained industry-wide supply growth. They expect the growth to slow to low single digits quarter-over-quarter in the latter half of 2024.
This slowdown is partly due to capacity shifts toward high-bandwidth memory ( HBM ). It is expected to enter a new supercycle that could significantly enhance Micron’s gross margins. The investment firm pointed out Micron’s production of HBM3E , the latest generation of high-bandwidth memory. It has the potential to achieve over 60% gross margin.
Super Micro Computer (SMCI)

Super Micro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ: SMCI ), known as Supermicro, is a global leader in high-performance, high-efficiency server technology and innovation. The company provides advanced server solutions, storage systems, and cloud computing technologies.
Wall Street analysts recently highlighted SMCI as one of the top chip stocks to buy, describing the stock as the “Switzerland of AI ” following the company’s announcement of another set of strong quarterly results. Rosenblatt analysts, known for their expertise on chip stocks, pointed out that the company’s AI dynamics are “a sweet spot for the company’s building block architecture, Green computing, rapid broad platform deployment, and must-have liquid cooling capabilities.“
Similarly, analysts at Loop Capital reiterated their Buy rating on shares of Super Micro Computer, maintaining a price target of $1,500. The firm anchors its positive stance on the stock in Super Micro’s well-positioned AI dynamics, driven by the company’s building block architecture.

2024-05-22,3 Inexpensive Stocks That Could Deliver Jaw-Dropping Returns,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Everything looks expensive right now.
From groceries to travel and fuel, we’ve seen massive price hikes across all industries. And unless inflation cools, we must deal with it. However, investors can make the most of the impact of inflation on the stocks. Several stocks have seen a drop in value despite reporting impressive quarterly results.
So, could this be your chance to pounce? A few inexpensive high-potential stocks can deliver jaw-dropping returns, and they have already reported strong fundamentals.
Each stock trades below $200 and present as a long-term buy and hold. As some of the best companies in their respective industries, these stocks have the strength to survive the market turmoil and rise higher. Let’s take a look at them.
Airbnb (ABNB)
Source: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com
Beaten-down Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB ) stock is trading at $143 today and has lost 8% value in the past month. The company has been under pressure after the first-quarter results since investors weren’t happy with the guidance.
Airbnb had the best Q1 ever with 133 million nights and experiences booked. It reported an 18% year-over-year ( YOY ) jump in revenue to hit $2.1 billion. The net income came in at $264 million, which is also its most profitable first quarter.
However, the market only paid attention to the guideline for the second quarter which shadowed the impressive numbers. The management is aiming for a 9% revenue growth in Q2 to hit $2.7 billion, lower than the growth achieved in the first quarter and below estimates. Since Airbnb operates an asset-light model, it has the potential to gain financial strength with each profitable quarter.
I believe Airbnb is a solid long-term play and am impressed at the company’s bounce-back post pandemic. The summer travel could lead to better-than-expected results for the company.
ABNB gives strong competition to hotels and is using technology to enhance user experience. I think the market reaction is overdone, and the recent dip in the stock is a chance to accumulate.

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has had a poor start to 2024, and its price has only started to recover slowly. The company reported a drop in iPhone sales due to the economic downturn and also announced a massive buyback. Investors aren’t very convinced about the future of Apple. But I believe this is one company that can bounce back at any time.
Up 3% year-to-date ( YTD ), AAPL exchanges hands for $192 and is moving closer to the 52-week high of $199. If you can keep the drop in iPhone sales aside, Apple looks like a highly lucrative business with a powerful brand name. Its service segment is thriving and has outperformed other segments. In the recent quarter , it reported a 14% YOY revenue jump.
Moreover, Apple enjoys high brand loyalty and this has helped it expand across the world. Someone using an Apple product today might not easily switch to another brand. Yes, one cannot ignore the China problem , but I think Apple has the potential to handle this situation well.
Also, it has enough resources to keep innovating and offering the most technologically advanced products to consumers. Apple has announced the largest share repurchase in history and this move has worked in its favor. Additionally, it declared a 25-cent dividend for shareholders. Looking at the company’s growth story, the stock looks inexpensive at the current level and is a buy-and-hold.
Amazon (AMZN)

E-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is exchanging hands for $183 today and is up 23% YTD. The stock has seen a steady rise over the past 12 months, and it is not long before it hits $200.
The company reported a blowout quarter driven by the cloud segment and advertising revenue. With two of its fastest-growing segments, Amazon has become so much more than an e-commerce company.
It saw a 13% jump in sales to $143.3 billion. The cloud segment, Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) showed a 17% YOY revenue growth while the advertising segment was up 24% YOY. Notably, the net income reached $10.4 billion as compared to the net income of $3.2 billion in the same period the prior year.
Further, Amazon has a highly diversified business with multiple revenue sources which will continue driving growth. It started investing in artificial intelligence ( AI ) well in time to gain a higher market share with AWS. Thus, its investments have started to pay off. Finally, it also has enough cash flow to keep investing in the business.

2024-05-22,Monumental Funding Has Elon Musk AI Venture Primed For Takeoff,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Editor’s Note: This article was previously published under the title, “Learn How to Profit From Elon Musk’s $18 Billion AI Project” but has been updated to include the most recent information.
For years, one of the world’s richest men and arguably most influential tech visionary – Elon Musk – has mostly watched the AI Boom unfold from the sidelines.
That all changes now – quite literally any day.
That’s because just a few weeks ago, reports emerged suggesting that, any day now, Musk is set to secure up to $6 billion in funding for his new AI startup xAI.
Now, Musk founded xAI about a year ago. And to date, the company has done very little. Aside from launching its AI chatbot Grok – which many experts say matches up pound-for-pound with ChatGPT – things have been mostly quiet since xAI’s founding.
But this $6 billion funding round could change that in a dramatic way.
Of course, the thing about world-changing businesses is that they start with world-changing people. Those folks have revolutionary ideas. And when funded with billions of dollars, they turn those ideas into world-changing businesses.
After all, Apple ( AAPL ) only became what it is today thanks to Steve Jobs, who came up with the idea of the iPhone. Jobs then leveraged the enormous amount of money Apple was making off its computers to create the iPhone. And voila… Apple became a trillion-dollar company.
Similarly, Microsoft ( MSFT ) grew into a tech titan because of Bill Gates, who came up with the idea for Windows. Gates used the money Microsoft was making off its PCs to further develop Windows. And that allowed Microsoft to become a trillion-dollar company.
World-changing people with ample resources create world-changing businesses.
So… if you want to invest in world-changing businesses… start with the world-changing people gathering the resources necessary to bring their visions to life.
That is exactly the situation we have with Elon Musk and xAI today.
Invest in a World-Changer Like Elon Musk
We certainly believe that Elon Musk is a world-changer.
He co-founded PayPal ( PYPL ), the world’s largest digital payment platform, now worth nearly $70 billion…
And SpaceX , the world’s largest private space rocket firm, now worth about $180 billion.
He pioneered one of the world’s largest automakers in Tesla ( TSLA )…
And he’s also the man behind Neuralink , The Boring Company , and X .
Musk has influenced how we pay for things, what cars we drive, how we communicate online, how we see space…
I’d venture to say that he is one of the most influential business figures of the past 20 years.
A great example of world-changing.
And now this world-changing person has not only turned his focus to a new business venture at the heart of possibly the most transformative technology the world has ever seen. He’s also on the verge of reportedly acquiring $6 billion in funding to turn his AI vision into a reality.
Would you bet against him here – especially if he gets $6 billion next week to fund this operation?
I don’t think I would.
The Final Word
As we mentioned earlier, xAI has already launched its own impressive AI chatbot. And it did that with very little outside funding. Just imagine what Musk and company will be able to cook up with $6 billion in outside funding.
When all is said and done, xAI could be Elon Musk’s biggest venture yet – his signature mark on the world, if you will.
And right now, you have an opportunity to invest in xAI before this company takes off.
Now, it’s not a direct investment, per se. After all, xAI is barely a year old. It’s still a private startup, which means you can’t buy its stock anywhere.
But we have found a potentially huge “backdoor” investment into xAI. It’s a stock that you likely have never heard of before – but we think it could be the leading tech component supplier for this burgeoning AI titan.
If xAI does win the multi-trillion-dollar AI race… and Elon Musk does it again… then this stock could absolutely soar.
Get all the details about this potential future winner right now.

2024-05-22,Here's Why I Wouldn't Touch Apple Stock With a 10-Foot Pole,"For years, Apple 's (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock was a bedrock position in many people's portfolios. The company's growth, combined with the relative value of the stock, made it a no-brainer, and investors have been rewarded as a result. Over the past five years, Apple is up around 300% while the S&P 500 increased around 100%.
Any investor should be satisfied with this level of broader market outperformance, but those days may be over. The two factors (growth and value) that made Apple so compelling years ago no longer exist today. As a result, I wouldn't touch Apple stock with a 10-foot pole.
First, I'll tackle Apple's growth aspect. Apple's largest product line, the iPhone, has matured over the past decade. In earlier generations, each annual technological leap made it feasible to upgrade from year to year. This technological leap has narrowed, and consumers aren't as likely to upgrade as frequently. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended March 30), Apple's iPhone sales fell nearly 11% year over year.",2

2024-05-23,Could This Bull Market Buy Help You Become a Millionaire?,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has helped many investors become millionaires or at least generate a significant amount of wealth over the years.

For example, Apple, including dividend payments, has climbed more than 900% over the past decade.
In recent times, though, declining demand from China has weighed on earnings growth, and investors have seen Apple as slower than other tech companies to invest in the high-growth area of artificial intelligence (AI). As a result, the tech giant's shares have lagged behind; this year, they've hardly changed so far.
Still, Apple over time has proven it's a growth company you can count on, and a top buy during bull markets and beyond. So could this bull market buy help you become a millionaire in the coming years as it's done for others in the past? Let's find out.",3

PDD Holdings' previous earnings release beat expectations, but the stock still crashed. The trading after today's release was lukewarm.
Some factors in PDD Holdings' release, such as cash flows, suggest that the company's earnings quality and sustainability might not be great.
In this article, I explore why I remain bullish on PDD Holdings ahead of earnings, and why I am downgrading my rating to ""buy"" despite my continued bullishness.
PDD Holdings Inc. ( PDD ) just released its earnings for the first quarter. The release showed a 131% increase in revenue and a 202% increase in adjusted EPS. Both figures exceeded analysts' expectations by wide margins. The EPS growth in particular was nearly double what analysts expected. The stock, however, achieved just minor gains after the release came out.

2024-05-22,3 Chip Stocks to Buy to Invest in AI's Brain,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Shares in global chipmakers have continued to move higher presenting some compelling chip stocks to buy. This is amid a more favorable macro backdrop and unprecedented demand for high-end chips that power artificial intelligence ( AI ) apps. The investment appeal of these stocks received a notable boost after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM ), the world’s largest chip manufacturing company, reported April revenue up nearly 60% from the same period last year.
This marks the most substantial growth rate for the year 2024 thus far. TSMC is a crucial supplier for tech giants such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ). It has a strong performance signaling anticipated growth in customer operations.
Chip stocks maintain a favorable outlook on the risk-reward potential for global semiconductor stocks . Here, we look at three chip stocks to buy that are considered safe bets in the chipmaking sector.
Broadcom (AVGO)

Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO ) is a leading global technology company and one of the top chip stocks to buy. The company designs, develops and supplies various semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. Known for its extensive product portfolio, Broadcom’s offerings encompass data center networking, broadband access, software, and wireless connectivity.
Most recently, Barclays initiated coverage on Broadcom with a positive outlook, assigning an Overweight rating and a price target of $1,405. The brokerage firm highlighted that Broadcom is leading in the data center silicon market and poised to benefit from the burgeoning advancements in artificial intelligence ( AI ).
Broadcom’s inclusion in Barclays’ list of preferred names for the year stems from its robust data center silicon portfolio. Despite the semiconductor industry’s susceptibility to cyclical downturns, the company’s growing software business is recognized as a pivotal element in bolstering profitability and free cash flow.
Barclays’ attention to AI’s potential is timely. The firm anticipates a mid to high-20% growth rate for Broadcom next year. This surge will continue over the long haul, fueled by the company’s expertise in custom silicon and switching solutions.
Micron (MU)

Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU ) is a leading global innovative memory and storage solutions provider. Micron’s product portfolio includes DRAM, NAND flash memory and NOR flash memory, integral to advanced computing, mobile applications and data centers.
The company’s stock has surged on robust demand for high bandwidth memory this year. Micron is the supplier of these chips, alongside Samsung Electronics ( OTC:SSNLF ) and SK Hynix’s ( OTC:HXSCL ). Along these lines, Baird analysts recently upgraded their rating on Micron stock.
The brokerage firm cited significant growth opportunities for the company in the face of increasing demand for AI applications. The firm changed its rating from Neutral to Outperform. It’s anticipating substantial upside potential for the United States’ largest memory chip manufacturer.
The upgrade comes after Baird analysts researched the semiconductor industry, identifying positive trends in the Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) market that could benefit Micron. According to Baird, recent checks within the channel have revealed an outlook for memory that could be favorable over the next 12 to 18 months.
Additionally, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) has recognized the strong performance and market position of Micron. It has upgraded its rating from “Underweight” to “Equalweight” and substantially increased its price target from $98 to $130 — an increase of over 32% .
Baird’s report highlighted that DRAM prices surpass expectations, which could lead to constrained industry-wide supply growth. They expect the growth to slow to low single digits quarter-over-quarter in the latter half of 2024.
This slowdown is partly due to capacity shifts toward high-bandwidth memory ( HBM ). It is expected to enter a new supercycle that could significantly enhance Micron’s gross margins. The investment firm pointed out Micron’s production of HBM3E , the latest generation of high-bandwidth memory. It has the potential to achieve over 60% gross margin.
Super Micro Computer (SMCI)

Super Micro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ: SMCI ), known as Supermicro, is a global leader in high-performance, high-efficiency server technology and innovation. The company provides advanced server solutions, storage systems, and cloud computing technologies.
Wall Street analysts recently highlighted SMCI as one of the top chip stocks to buy, describing the stock as the “Switzerland of AI ” following the company’s announcement of another set of strong quarterly results. Rosenblatt analysts, known for their expertise on chip stocks, pointed out that the company’s AI dynamics are “a sweet spot for the company’s building block architecture, Green computing, rapid broad platform deployment, and must-have liquid cooling capabilities.“
Similarly, analysts at Loop Capital reiterated their Buy rating on shares of Super Micro Computer, maintaining a price target of $1,500. The firm anchors its positive stance on the stock in Super Micro’s well-positioned AI dynamics, driven by the company’s building block architecture.

2024-05-22,3 Inexpensive Stocks That Could Deliver Jaw-Dropping Returns,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Everything looks expensive right now.
From groceries to travel and fuel, we’ve seen massive price hikes across all industries. And unless inflation cools, we must deal with it. However, investors can make the most of the impact of inflation on the stocks. Several stocks have seen a drop in value despite reporting impressive quarterly results.
So, could this be your chance to pounce? A few inexpensive high-potential stocks can deliver jaw-dropping returns, and they have already reported strong fundamentals.
Each stock trades below $200 and present as a long-term buy and hold. As some of the best companies in their respective industries, these stocks have the strength to survive the market turmoil and rise higher. Let’s take a look at them.
Airbnb (ABNB)
Source: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com
Beaten-down Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB ) stock is trading at $143 today and has lost 8% value in the past month. The company has been under pressure after the first-quarter results since investors weren’t happy with the guidance.
Airbnb had the best Q1 ever with 133 million nights and experiences booked. It reported an 18% year-over-year ( YOY ) jump in revenue to hit $2.1 billion. The net income came in at $264 million, which is also its most profitable first quarter.
However, the market only paid attention to the guideline for the second quarter which shadowed the impressive numbers. The management is aiming for a 9% revenue growth in Q2 to hit $2.7 billion, lower than the growth achieved in the first quarter and below estimates. Since Airbnb operates an asset-light model, it has the potential to gain financial strength with each profitable quarter.
I believe Airbnb is a solid long-term play and am impressed at the company’s bounce-back post pandemic. The summer travel could lead to better-than-expected results for the company.
ABNB gives strong competition to hotels and is using technology to enhance user experience. I think the market reaction is overdone, and the recent dip in the stock is a chance to accumulate.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has had a poor start to 2024, and its price has only started to recover slowly. The company reported a drop in iPhone sales due to the economic downturn and also announced a massive buyback. Investors aren’t very convinced about the future of Apple. But I believe this is one company that can bounce back at any time.
Up 3% year-to-date ( YTD ), AAPL exchanges hands for $192 and is moving closer to the 52-week high of $199. If you can keep the drop in iPhone sales aside, Apple looks like a highly lucrative business with a powerful brand name. Its service segment is thriving and has outperformed other segments. In the recent quarter , it reported a 14% YOY revenue jump.
Moreover, Apple enjoys high brand loyalty and this has helped it expand across the world. Someone using an Apple product today might not easily switch to another brand. Yes, one cannot ignore the China problem , but I think Apple has the potential to handle this situation well.
Also, it has enough resources to keep innovating and offering the most technologically advanced products to consumers. Apple has announced the largest share repurchase in history and this move has worked in its favor. Additionally, it declared a 25-cent dividend for shareholders. Looking at the company’s growth story, the stock looks inexpensive at the current level and is a buy-and-hold.

E-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is exchanging hands for $183 today and is up 23% YTD. The stock has seen a steady rise over the past 12 months, and it is not long before it hits $200.
The company reported a blowout quarter driven by the cloud segment and advertising revenue. With two of its fastest-growing segments, Amazon has become so much more than an e-commerce company.
It saw a 13% jump in sales to $143.3 billion. The cloud segment, Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) showed a 17% YOY revenue growth while the advertising segment was up 24% YOY. Notably, the net income reached $10.4 billion as compared to the net income of $3.2 billion in the same period the prior year.
Further, Amazon has a highly diversified business with multiple revenue sources which will continue driving growth. It started investing in artificial intelligence ( AI ) well in time to gain a higher market share with AWS. Thus, its investments have started to pay off. Finally, it also has enough cash flow to keep investing in the business.

2024-05-22,Monumental Funding Has Elon Musk AI Venture Primed For Takeoff,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Editor’s Note: This article was previously published under the title, “Learn How to Profit From Elon Musk’s $18 Billion AI Project” but has been updated to include the most recent information.
For years, one of the world’s richest men and arguably most influential tech visionary – Elon Musk – has mostly watched the AI Boom unfold from the sidelines.
That all changes now – quite literally any day.
That’s because just a few weeks ago, reports emerged suggesting that, any day now, Musk is set to secure up to $6 billion in funding for his new AI startup xAI.
Now, Musk founded xAI about a year ago. And to date, the company has done very little. Aside from launching its AI chatbot Grok – which many experts say matches up pound-for-pound with ChatGPT – things have been mostly quiet since xAI’s founding.
But this $6 billion funding round could change that in a dramatic way.
Of course, the thing about world-changing businesses is that they start with world-changing people. Those folks have revolutionary ideas. And when funded with billions of dollars, they turn those ideas into world-changing businesses.
After all, Apple ( AAPL ) only became what it is today thanks to Steve Jobs, who came up with the idea of the iPhone. Jobs then leveraged the enormous amount of money Apple was making off its computers to create the iPhone. And voila… Apple became a trillion-dollar company.
Similarly, Microsoft ( MSFT ) grew into a tech titan because of Bill Gates, who came up with the idea for Windows. Gates used the money Microsoft was making off its PCs to further develop Windows. And that allowed Microsoft to become a trillion-dollar company.
World-changing people with ample resources create world-changing businesses.
So… if you want to invest in world-changing businesses… start with the world-changing people gathering the resources necessary to bring their visions to life.
That is exactly the situation we have with Elon Musk and xAI today.
Invest in a World-Changer Like Elon Musk
We certainly believe that Elon Musk is a world-changer.
He co-founded PayPal ( PYPL ), the world’s largest digital payment platform, now worth nearly $70 billion…
And SpaceX , the world’s largest private space rocket firm, now worth about $180 billion.
He pioneered one of the world’s largest automakers in Tesla ( TSLA )…
And he’s also the man behind Neuralink , The Boring Company , and X .
Musk has influenced how we pay for things, what cars we drive, how we communicate online, how we see space…
I’d venture to say that he is one of the most influential business figures of the past 20 years.
A great example of world-changing.
And now this world-changing person has not only turned his focus to a new business venture at the heart of possibly the most transformative technology the world has ever seen. He’s also on the verge of reportedly acquiring $6 billion in funding to turn his AI vision into a reality.
Would you bet against him here – especially if he gets $6 billion next week to fund this operation?
I don’t think I would.
The Final Word
As we mentioned earlier, xAI has already launched its own impressive AI chatbot. And it did that with very little outside funding. Just imagine what Musk and company will be able to cook up with $6 billion in outside funding.
When all is said and done, xAI could be Elon Musk’s biggest venture yet – his signature mark on the world, if you will.
And right now, you have an opportunity to invest in xAI before this company takes off.
Now, it’s not a direct investment, per se. After all, xAI is barely a year old. It’s still a private startup, which means you can’t buy its stock anywhere.
But we have found a potentially huge “backdoor” investment into xAI. It’s a stock that you likely have never heard of before – but we think it could be the leading tech component supplier for this burgeoning AI titan.
If xAI does win the multi-trillion-dollar AI race… and Elon Musk does it again… then this stock could absolutely soar.
Get all the details about this potential future winner right now.

2024-05-22,Here's Why I Wouldn't Touch Apple Stock With a 10-Foot Pole,"For years, Apple 's (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock was a bedrock position in many people's portfolios. The company's growth, combined with the relative value of the stock, made it a no-brainer, and investors have been rewarded as a result. Over the past five years, Apple is up around 300% while the S&P 500 increased around 100%.
Any investor should be satisfied with this level of broader market outperformance, but those days may be over. The two factors (growth and value) that made Apple so compelling years ago no longer exist today. As a result, I wouldn't touch Apple stock with a 10-foot pole.
First, I'll tackle Apple's growth aspect. Apple's largest product line, the iPhone, has matured over the past decade. In earlier generations, each annual technological leap made it feasible to upgrade from year to year. This technological leap has narrowed, and consumers aren't as likely to upgrade as frequently. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended March 30), Apple's iPhone sales fell nearly 11% year over year.",3

2024-05-22,Weird But Wonderful: 3 Altcoins With 10X Potential This Year,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Altcoins get weirder and more wonderful as time goes on, from multi-tasking blockchains to AI-powered graphic design. It sure is a far cry from the original cryptos created merely as a form of currency. This makes us spoiled for choice as to which altcoins to buy.
But cryptos are inherently high-risk investments for speculators putting their hard-earned money into them. So I’ve picked out three altcoins to buy that I think have enough potential to hit 10X this year.
This potential comes from factors like proven growth, upcoming projects, mainstream acceptance and financial backing
Moreover, if you look at the charts, you’ll see almost all AI altcoins positioned in a bullish cup and handle formation. This fits perfectly with upcoming AI sector launches that will act as catalysts for AI cryptos. OpenAI in particular, will launch several projects this summer which will act as such catalysts.
Here are 3 AI-based altcoins to buy.
Toncoin (TON-USD)
Source: Have a nice day Photo/Shutterstock
Toncoin ( TON-USD ) is a blockchain originally developed by Telegram . Today, it is developed by The Open Network (TON) Foundation. The blockchain operates across games, transactions, NFTs and more.
TON shot up to revisit its recent all-time highs. The anticipated launch of the Notcoin (NOT) token on the TON network was a driver behind the move. It saw $294 million in trading volume on the May 16 launch day alone.
The chart shows strong buying pressure against resistance. Price action looks even more bullish than its recent run that created an all-time high. A bull flag is currently forming just below it.
A break of the all-time high of $7.63 could see prices reach $10 in the short term. No further chart resistance after that. This makes it one of the more exciting altcoins to buy this year.
Keep an eye on broader crypto market conditions as well as AI catalysts. These will help to serve as confirmation of TON’s upward moves going forward.
Render (RNDR-USD)
Source: Maurice NORBERT / Shutterstock.com
Render ( RNDR-USD ) produces decentralized GPU-based 3D rendering solutions. RNDR’s token spiked after their project was featured at Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) recent event . Like TON, RNDR is forming a huge bull flag in the short term. This is at the same time as the cup and handle pattern on the long-term chart that most AI cryptos are showing. This confluence of patterns shows great promise for a price rise this year.
If the bull flag plays out as expected, RNDR could go to $17 as per the cup and handle target.
But whether it plays out will depend in big part on AI catalysts. These include Chat GPT-5 , the OpenAI search engine , and the video product Sora . Watch how the AI sector performs over the summer. This will impact RNDR’s price. The more successful releases of AI catalysts, the better it looks. But the launches being successful are a must! Watch that sector closely.
Akash (AKT-USD)
Source: Blackboard / Shutterstock
Akash ( AKT-USD ) network is one of the pioneers of cloud computing, using open-source blockchain technology and the eco-friendly proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.
Following on from my analysis of AKT last week , the AKT coin appears to be consolidating its position within an Elliot wave third leg up. It completed a 5-wave pattern back up to resistance which could be the first leg of wave 3.
On the fundamentals side, it recently pumped in response to a combination of OpenAI’s upcoming announcement and Akash Network’s own upcoming event in Argentina.
AKT looks very bullish on its longer-term price chart. A massive cup and handle pattern is showing. If it plays out along with the Elliot wave confluence of patterns, AKT could break out hard.
Despite the technicals, moving upwards in the short term depends on the success of the upcoming AI catalysts. Look for a break of $6.15 for a potential entry point.

2024-05-21,3 ETFs to Buy Now: May 2024,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Investors can outperform the market by picking the right ETFs instead of monitoring dozens of stocks. ETFs offer exposure to numerous corporations and often follow a theme. For instance, some ETFs prioritize large-cap companies in the United States, while others allocate their capital toward international small-cap stocks.
Investors can choose from many funds, but it’s important to look at historical returns and current holdings. Looking at these details can help you determine the top ETFs to buy now. These are some of the most promising funds available.
iShares US Technology ETF (IYW)
The iShares US Technology ETF (NYSEARCA: IYW ) gives investors exposure to U.S. tech companies. The fund’s top positions are the Magnificent Seven stocks. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) make up more than 45% of the fund’s total assets.
If those three stocks continue to perform well, IYW should have no issue with outperforming the stock market. The fund has done just that over several years. IYW has an annualized return of 20% over the past decade. The iShares US Technology ETF also has a responsible 0.40% expense ratio.
Although most of the fund’s capital is allocated across a few stocks, the fund has more than 100 holdings. It has a heavy focus on tech, with Software & Services representing 40% of total assets. Semiconductors are right behind it with a 30% position in the fund. Tech hardware and media are the other two sectors within the fund. The remaining sectors each have less than 1% of the fund’s total assets. If you like tech stocks, you’ll enjoy IYW.
Schwab US Large-Cap Growth ETF (SCHG)
Source: iQoncept / Shutterstock
The Schwab US Large-Cap Growth ETF (NYSEARCA: SCHG ) uses the Dow Jones US Large-Cap Growth Total Stock Market Index as its benchmark. The fund offers exposure to large-cap U.S. equities and diversifies its holdings across 250 stocks.
SCHG has the same top three holdings as IYW but with lower concentrations. Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia make up more than 30% of the fund’s total assets. The fund is up by 15% year-to-date and has an annualized return of 15% over the past five years. Investors will keep most of their gains, as the fund only has a 0.04% expense ratio.
Investors will also receive steady cash flow from SCHG. It has a 30-day SEC yield of 0.37%. Almost half of the fund’s total assets are in the Information Technology sector. The next three sectors are Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary and Health Care. Each of these sectors has around 10% or more of the fund’s total assets.
Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF (XLG)
Source: SWKStock / Shutterstock
The Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF (NYSEARCA: XLG ) takes an innovative approach to the S&P 500 . Instead of having the top 500 profitable corporations based on market cap, XLG only holds the top 50 stocks within the index.
This methodology gives XLG investors outsized exposure to the Magnificent Seven stocks. It’s a common theme among the top-performing index funds and ETFs. Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia make up more than 30% of the fund’s total assets. More than 40% of the fund’s assets are in the Information Technology Sector. Communication Services, Health Care, Consumer Discretionary and Financial each consist of around 10% or more of the fund’s total assets.
XLG has a 30-day SEC yield of 0.90% and an expense ratio of 0.20%. Distributions are paid out quarterly in March, June, September and December. The fund has performed well and has an annualized return of around 15% over the past five years.

2024-05-21,3 Reasons Not to Waste Your Time on Apple Stock This Year,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Apple ‘s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) share price has only just started to recover after a poor start to the year. During mid-April, the tech giant’s stock price had fallen by more than 14%. The lack of demand for consumer technology products after COVID-19 precipitated a glut of them and the subsequent rise of inflation are just a couple of reasons why AAPL has underperformed its $1-trillion-dollar market cap peers.
Since the start of May until the end of last Friday’s trading session, Apple shares have rallied nearly 14%. However, investors, particularly retail investors, should not be fooled by this stock price surge. The iPhone-maker has a number of risks facing its sales and net income growth.
The outlook for consumer tech products is still grim
A few weeks ago, Apple released its second quarter earnings report for fiscal year 2024 and markets reacted positively. The announcement of the largest share buyback program in the iPhone-maker’s history as well as its apparent optimism on long-term growth seemed to have elated analysts, investors, and traders alike. However, if we glean closely at the company’s financial figures, there is little materially to be excited about.
Total quarterly revenue continued to fall – this time by 4% – to $90.8 billion. In particular, Apple’s product revenue, which includes iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks, fell by nearly 10% on a year-over-year basis. While services revenue was able to accelerate by 14% from the same period in 2023, analysts don’t put a lot of weight into that segment, driving the company’s long-term growth.
Inflation remains elevated and so do real interest rates. These macroeconomic factors coupled with the points that the consumer electronics market is full of sophisticated competitors and is facing market glut will lead to a continued diminution of sales figures for the near and medium terms and perhaps even in the long term.
Apple’s “China problem” has only magnified
Undergirding much of Apple’s woes are developments in the world’s second-largest economy, China. The country’s technology champion, Huawei, released the Mate 60 Pro in September, with a system-on-a-chip (SoC) designed and manufactured in China. This sent a strong message to not just Apple but also U.S. policy officials that their consecutive rounds of sanctions had inadvertently created a rising domestic semiconductor ecosystem in China. The recent Huawei Pura 70 is the latest success the company has shown the world in its fight to overcome U.S. sanctions.
What has happened in the meantime is Apple has lost a significant amount of market share to Huawei in China. At the end of the first quarter of 2024, the iPhone-maker lost its spot as the top-selling handset brand in China as both Huawei and Honor, once a Huawei brand, took the top spots. In particular, Honor’s market share sat around 17.1% while Huawei’s climbed to 17%.
These developments in China must not be understated because they will have a significant impact on Apple’s long-term sales and net income growth.
Apple lacks a long-term product strategy
Let’s be clear. Apple generates tens of billions of dollars in profits for shareholders each year. However, despite being an obvious cash cow, the lack of a coherent strategy to deploy that cash to tractable products is leading to the iPhone maker’s lethargic decline. There is a lot of hope from analysts that Apple’s new M4 chip which will eventually go into new MacBooks will increase the tech firm’s lagging sales growth. Of course, that has yet to be seen. A lot of the demand for AI products tends to be on the enterprise side, especially if we look at cloud companies that manage large data centers. An AI-enhanced MacBook might spark a lot of consumer interest, but will consumers start pouring back into Apple products because of it? That I’m not confident about.
There is also a number of failed projects, such as the defunct Apple Car and the failed in-house wireless modem, which should also leave investors skeptical about the company’s ability to successfully drive innovation.
At the end of the day, the iPhone-maker needs a series of innovative products to spur growth in the long run. Whether it can deliver remains up in the air for now.

2024-05-21,Retire in Style: 3 Stocks to Buy Now for a Plush Future,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
If you’re looking to retire comfortably with a jumbo-sized nest egg, focus on businesses that raise the bar on themselves. In the age of generative artificial intelligence ( AI ), I’d look out for companies that adapt quickly to unlock substantial benefits.
Indeed, AI stands to benefit more than just the tech firms investing billions into chatbots or large language models ( LLM s). Also, enterprise users of such technologies will see some productivity gains and perhaps even cost savings.
Either way, AI is one of those emerging technologies you can’t ignore. So, let’s examine three stocks that can adapt to the new age and perhaps help you achieve a fairly plush future.
Walmart (WMT)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
Big-box retailer Walmart (NYSE: WMT ) hasn’t only adapted to the digital age. It is starting to become an innovator in its own right. After the incredible quarterly print that sent WMT stock soaring over 7% in a single trading session, the big question is this. Just how much of a historical premium should investors be willing to pay?
At 27.7 times trailing price-to-earnings ( P/E ), WMT is definitely on the higher end for a retailer known for rock-bottom prices. Part of the premium can be attributed to Walmart is offering customers great deals at a time when it’s hard to stay within one’s weekly grocery budget. After all, it’s not hard to imagine that inflation is to thank for the recent sales surge.
In a recent conference call, Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) Doug McMillion stated the recent quarter was “not inflation-driven results.” And that his firm is poised to continue growing “whether the environment is inflationary or deflationary.”
Consumers continue to regard Walmart as the cheapest place to shop, regardless of where prices are heading. As Walmart rolls back on prices , expect sales to swell even further, especially if rivals can’t keep up with price cuts.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Moab Republic / Shutterstock
Those who ditched Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) may be kicking themselves right about now. The stock is now up more than 15% in the past month.
Wall Street’s narrative was that Apple was “falling behind” in the AI race. And, with a lack of a new hit product (it’s looking like the first version of Vision Pro won’t fit the bill), the firm was poised for sub-par growth.
With Apple’s upcoming WWDC24 event June 10-14, the degree of renewed investor enthusiasm is almost palpable.
Sure, a handful of big-tech firms have already had their chance to wow crowds with their latest generative AI powers.
Nevertheless, investors seem more than willing to give the Vision Pro maker the benefit of the doubt again. Consider the potential for OpenAI to share the stage at WWDC24. Only time will tell if OpenAI and Apple announce something substantial. If they do, AAPL stock may be looking at a new all-time high for the summer.
Home Depot (HD)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
Home Depot (NYSE: HD ) is down almost 15% from its 52-week high and 19% from its 2021 all-time high. As well-managed as Home Depot is, it still hasn’t been able to fly clear of industry headwinds. After a turbulent recent quarter, the company noted that home improvement demand faces challenges. And, the firm has to deal with the uncertainty of consumer purchasing habits.
Indeed, volatility has the potential to swing both ways. And in due time, Home Depot will find itself flying with the wind at its back again. Until then, the company faces lower expectations for future quarters, making it a potentially decent time to punch one’s long-term ticket.
Until the tides turn, Home Depot can unlock further efficiencies across operations with a helping hand from AI . Such efficiencies should help the firm make the most of the next cyclical upswing in home improvement projects. For now, the stock looks like a decent value post-Q1 at just 23.1 times trailing P/E.

2024-05-21,3 Sectors That Will Suffer Most From the Biden China Tariffs,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
After looking at China’s trade tactics under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, the Biden government is raising taxes on $18 billion of Chinese imports. China is accused of “unfair” trade practices, especially regarding intellectual property, technology transfer, and subsidies. Several sectors are at risk from these Biden China tariffs.
With taxes put on Chinese goods in 2018, President Donald Trump ignited the trade war. A 25% tariff was placed on $34 billion in products, rising to roughly $360 billion by 2019. These tariffs targeted many commodities.
In January 2020, China promised to buy $200 billion more U.S. products and services under a Phase One trade pact over two years. With this accord, the U.S. suspended proposed tariffs and reduced some current ones.
While keeping the taxes that were in place under Trump, the Biden government is introducing new ones worth billions to protect U.S. industry and stop market abuse in areas like electric cars, electronics, and solar energy.
For investors, it’s important to consider the sectors at risk from the Biden China tariffs. The new taxes have raised costs, hurting U.S. businesses like technology and the car industry.
Sectors at Risk from Biden China Tariffs: Technology Sector
Electric vehicles, or EVs, solar cells and panels, lithium-ion batteries, and semiconductor chips are among the tech sectors most at risk from the Biden China tariffs, as rumors circulate regarding the possible revocation of China’s status as a “most favored nation” for trade.
On the EV end, the tariffs are set to increase from 27.5% to 102.5% in 2024 to counteract the flooding of low-cost cars into the U.S. market, which doesn’t bode well for Chinese EV startups looking to make inroads into America.
Meanwhile, the tax on solar cells and panels will go from 25% to 50% , which is meant to limit Chinese production of solar panels, pushing down prices worldwide.
Lithium-ion EV batteries will have their tariffs raised from 7.5% to 25% , with the same to happen with non-EV batteries in 2026.
Major tech conglomerates like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will suffer as a result of these policies. Apple immediately started production in China when it joined the WTO and remains particularly reliant on China for the supply of semiconductor chips. A shortage of these chips led to the first revenue miss for the FAANG stock since 2018, reducing revenue by roughly $6 billion.
Automotive Industry
Previous tariffs on Chinese EVs were 25%. Along with the 2.5% levy on all foreign-made autos, the total was 27.5%. However, the tariff on Chinese EVs will increase to 100%, quadrupling from the previous rate, making it one of the sectors most at risk from the Biden China tariffs.
The tariffs do not bode well for Chinese automakers trying to make a mark in North America. For instance, Nio (NYSE: NIO ) plans to enter the North American market by 2025 and is doing homework regarding showrooms and manufacturing facilities.
On the other hand, BYD (OTCMKTS: BYDDF ) manufactures automobiles in Mexico to take advantage of USMCA tariff relief if they fulfill local standards. BYD’s Seagull is a compact hatchback with a range of up to 250 miles; the basic model costs around $10,700 , about one-third of the price of the least expensive EV available in the U.S.
In China, Volvo is part of the Geely group. These companies are trying to determine how the taxes will affect their cars, like the Polestar 2 luxury electric vehicle and the Volvo S90 hybrid SUV.
Chinese steel and metal are essential to car-making in the States, but the White House wants to raise taxes from 0–7.5% to 25% . According to the CHIPS and Science Act, Chinese chip taxes will also double in 2025.
Consumer Goods
The new tariffs affect $18 billion worth of imports from China, and consumer goods not covered under the Trump administration’s tariffs are also coming under the radar, affecting innumerable U.S. enterprises.
For instance, Walmart (NYSE: WMT ) imports electronics, apparel, and household products from China; tariffs will raise prices, which means higher customer prices and lower margins for Walmart. Walmart will find these tariffs will detract from its solid momentum this year, thanks to a 3-to-1 stock split in February and healthy Q1 e-commerce sales growth of 22%.
Similar to Walmart, Target (NYSE: TGT ) purchases a large amount of goods from China, including clothing, gadgets, and household products. Although Target sources from over 30 different origins , the bulk of its imports come from China, putting it in a precarious position, like other retailers, due to the tariffs; it has five Mainland China offices , with its origins in the country dating back to 1994 in Shanghai.
Moreover, many of Nike’s (NYSE: NKE ) clothing and footwear come from China. Tariffs will raise expenses, which might result in lower profitability. This is not the best news for NKE stockholders after the company said it anticipates a dip in sales during the first half.

2024-05-21,Worldwide Takeover: 3 Stocks Poised for Global Domination,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Consider buying these stocks if you want your portfolio to grow!
The global stock market is undergoing profound transformations right now, with the rapid globalization of traditional companies, as well as the decentralization of the world’s largest companies, with many rising out of Asia, as opposed to the 20th and 21st centuries, which saw a great increase in companies which arose in the West.
Today, I have focused on three stocks that I think have great potential in both the domestic and international markets and offer great solutions to various global problems. Additionally, all these companies have great growth potential, making them great stocks poised for global dominance.
Here are three stocks that I think you should invest in:
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM ) is a semiconductor manufacturer offering international access to chip fabrication and engineering services, being best known for manufacturing chips for industry giants such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ). TSM is trading at $153+ with a market cap of ~$680 billion.
Revenue estimates are stable, ranging from $19.74 to $20.01 billion for this quarter. Additionally, TSM regularly beats estimates, with EPS surprising investors by 4.50% last quarter. Revenue and earnings held still, with quarterly YoY revenue growth of 16.50% , and quarterly YoY earnings growth at 8.90%.

The semiconductor sector has a projected CAGR of 12.2% until 2029. However, factors such as market volatility, supply and demand shocks, and geopolitical tensions could cause this growth to stagnate. To mitigate these risks, TSM is diversifying its factories out of East Asia and into more stable countries, which is why this stock is a buy.
Celsius (CELH)

Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH ) develops, processes, markets, distributes and sells functional energy drinks and liquid supplements in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and internationally.
CELH stock has seen year-over-year (YoY) quarterly revenue growth of 36.80% with an overall revenue of 1.41 billion dollars . Like TSM stock, Celsius regularly beats estimates, and EPS surprised investors by 42.10% last quarter. Celsius Holdings has had a profit margin of 18.63% along with an operating margin of 23.39% which further solidifies its appeal as a stock poised for global domination.
The global energy drink market is still a growth market anticipated to outpace economic expansion by a wide margin. Celsius has to face some fierce competitors – companies like Red Bull and Monster. But great financials, an innovative product line, and plans to go international make CELH stock a must-buy.
ServiceNow (NOW)

ServiceNow Inc. (NYSE: NOW ) provides end-to-end intelligent workflow automation platform solutions for digital businesses in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific and internationally. Currently, it is trading at ~$771, with a market cap of ~$158 billion.
NOW stock has quarterly earnings growth of 131.30% and a huge positive operating cash flow of $3.84 billion . This has led analysts to set a price target of $860.88, representing a 12.5% growth potential. This is combined with the fact that both earnings and revenue have seen steady growth over the last few years.
Additionally, NOW has started to expand hiring by increasing the number of Salesforce employees it hires; with Salesforce being its biggest competitor. Stealing high-quality workers, great financials, and the opportunity to grow in an international market make this top-rated technology growth stock a buy.

2024-05-21,Intel Stock is an AI Play You Can Skip Out On,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) may capitalize on the generative AI trend, but Intel stock has moved the other way so far this year. It’s uncertain if the chip maker will find success in producing AI-compatible chips for the PC market.
Add in other risks, and there may not be enough in play to counter the key issue that weighs on shares. With this, forget about any sort of “fear of missing out” with INTC. The big fear here is the fear of getting stuck holding the bag.
Intel Stock: Bouncing Back But Still Trending Lower
During March and April, INTC experienced a steady slide in price, from around $45 to around $30 per share. The general sell-off in AI stocks during this time of course played a role in this. However, his big decline was in large part due to some discouraging news out of the company.
First, in early April, Intel admitted that its turnaround, which relies heavily on the company becoming a major chip foundry, will not really start to play out until later this decade .
Second, later in them month, Intel released its latest quarterly results. While beating on earnings, Intel’s revenue for the quarter fell short of consensus estimates.
Worse yet, the company provided very underwhelming guidance for the current quarter. Focusing on this major negative, investors bid down Intel stock in response. Yes, since the April 25 earnings release, shares have bounced back, albeit slightly.
Investors have reacted positively to the latest news regarding Intel’s global buildout of its chip manufacturing capacity . However, while inching higher in the short-term, INTC remains on a long-term downward trajectory.
It may be able to hold at or near present price levels for now, but not for long.
Why the Dust has Not Necessarily Settled
With Intel stock finding support at $30 per share, it may seem as though it has finally bottomed out, and that a rebound will continue. After all, take a look at 2025 earnings forecasts.
The sell-side expects Intel’s earnings to nearly double next year, from $1.10 per share to $2.01 per share. This consensus forecast suggests that AI-PC growth will help mitigate the impact of the foundry buildout. However, these forecasts may overly aggressive.
As mentioned above, while Intel may be moving aggressively into the AI-PC chip market, Intel’s success in this market could fall short of expectations. Why? Competition, and not only competition from the likes of its more cutting edge direct competitors. As we pointed out in a prior article on Intel, Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) AI-PC chips, designed in-house, could give competing chips a run for their money.
If underwhelming success in AI-PC chips is coupled with, say, further headwinds stemming from the U.S.-China trade war , it may prove difficult for 2025 results to meet expectations. In the event this scenario becomes more likely to play out, the market could do yet another downward revision to INTC’s valuation.
The Verdict: More Declines Remain Very Possible
Following the sell-off, investors are no longer pricing-in the foundry catalyst so strongly, but the AI-PC chips catalyst remains well baked into the valuation. In the months ahead, this could change, driving Intel down back to its multi-year lows in the mid-$20s per share.
Alongside downside risk in the short run, is the risk of subpar returns in the long-run. Given how long its going to take for Intel to possibly make a full exit out of its slump, shares could underperform peers in a big way over the next few years.
Whether you bought in before its short-lived late 2023 hot run, or if you’ve “bought the dip” in recent months, we reiterate that there’s little need to maintain an Intel stock position right now.

2024-05-21,MSFT Alert: Buy Microsoft Stock Before the Next Move Higher,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
While it has traded sideways over the past few months, it likely won’t be long before Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) stock makes its next move higher. So far this year, Microsoft stock has risen 13%, which is only slightly better than the 12% increase in the benchmark S&P 500 index.
The shares have stagnated after Microsoft achieved a $3 trillion market capitalization in late January, surpassing Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) to become the world’s biggest publicly traded company. With its leadership in AI, Microsoft stock is likely to gain momentum in the near-term.
AI Features
Microsoft recently teased several new artificial intelligence tools for use with its Windows operating system and its cloud-computing infrastructure. Analysts expect more details at Microsoft’s annual Build conference at the end of May.
Media reports say that Microsoft plans to announce a new advanced Paste feature for Windows that will allow people to run AI models directly on their personal computer (PC) rather than send data to the cloud.
Earlier this year, Microsoft introduced new Surface PCs that feature a Copilot button for quick access to the company’s AI chatbot. Microsoft will discuss Windows apps accessing new AI features at the Build conference. The company plans to introduce AI safety features to reduce chatbot security risks and improve the Copilot chatbot.
These are just the latest ways in which Microsoft is cementing its global leadership in the red-hot field of AI. The company also continues to have a close relationship with privately held OpenAI , which it has invested more than $10 billion into.
OpenAI recently announced new AI plans of its own, including an artificial intelligence-powered search engine aimed at competing against Google and a partnership with social media company Reddit (NYSE: RDDT ).
Growth on All Fronts
Microsoft continues to report financial results that show growth on all fronts at the company. In particular, the company’s first-quarter print showed accelerating growth in cloud-computing.
The company’s Intelligent Cloud segment, including the Azure public cloud, earned $26.71 billion in revenue during the quarter. That was up 21% from the previous year and ahead of the $26.26 billion expected among analysts. Revenue from Azure alone grew 31% from a year ago.
Other highlights from the earnings report include revenue from the Xbox video game unit rising 62% year-over-year due to a lift from its $68 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard , which makes popular game titles such as “Call of Duty.”
Sales of Windows licenses to device makers rose 11%. During the quarter, Microsoft began selling access to the Copilot chatbot for small businesses with Microsoft 365 productivity software subscriptions.
The strong earnings and growth across multiple business segments is why 33 professional analysts currently rate MSFT stock a strong buy with a median price target of $491.56 per share, which is 17% higher than where the shares currently trade.
Buy Microsoft Stock
Microsoft stock hasn’t lit the world on fire lately. The stock will likely move higher as AI technologies, cloud-computing and video games contribute to its growth.
Analysts remain bullish on Microsoft and its future outlook, and the company’s strength has led it to become the world’s most valuable publicly traded company. Investors should keep the faith. Microsoft stock is a buy .

2024-05-20,Ride Out the Turbulence: 3 EV Stocks to Own for Massive Wealth Creation,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Reportedly, the death of electric vehicles has been overly exaggerated, according to Forbes.com . All of which is creating an opportunity for EV stocks to buy.
They note that “global EV sales could hit 17 million in 2024, meaning more than one in five cars sold worldwide will be electric. Surging demand for clean, cheap EVs across the rest of this decade will completely change the global auto industry. By 2035, IEA projects 50% of all cars sold globally will be EVs.”
Plus, in the U.S., EV sales jumped 60% year-over-year from a million in 2022 to 1.6 million in 2023, says MarketWatch.com . They added that California, Florida, Texas and Washington leading the U.S. in EV registrations .
We should also note that sales could improve once the U.S. installs more EV charging stations. Also, when the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates. That being said, investors may want to take advantage of any weakness – especially in EV stocks to buy, such as:
Albemarle ( ALB )
Source: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com
Over the last few weeks, Albemarle (NYSE: ALB ) ran from a low of about $110 to a high of $137.50. Now back to $131.12, it’s starting to pivot higher again. ALB also declared a quarterly dividend of 40 cents a share, payable July 1 to shareholders of record as of June 14.
In addition, with lithium prices finally showing signs of bottoming out, ALB could push aggressively higher. We also have to consider that a significant amount of chaos and fear has been priced into ALB, too.
Also, according to analysts at Canaccord Genuity , lithium prices and related stocks are “poised to rebound by July.” The firm says lithium prices could reach $16,000 per tonne for chemicals, and $1,200 per tonne for spodumene concentrate.
“ Canaccord says it’s more confident in its current view that lithium has bottomed than it was last May due to production prices for lithium carbonate equivalent recently falling across several producers,” says NorthernMiner.com .
Tesla ( TSLA )

It’s time to buy the fear in Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ).
Granted, sales have slipped but it’s still dominating the EV market.
As noted by QZ.com , “While Tesla was out selling 50,000 new EVs, Ford was struggling to hit 10,000 EVs sold in second place. Behind it was Hyundai, which shifted 5,686 electric cars in March and BMW sold 4,246 electric models.”
And, as noted by Bernstein analysts, first-quarter deliveries were dire, but the margins were better than expected. Plus, Elon Musk did hint at newer, cheaper models, and a potentially new mapping partnership with Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ).
In addition, according to Investorplace contributor Chandler Capital , “The struggles for Tesla have been well-documented this year but Wall Street analysts have remained bullish on the future of the company. In April, the stock saw more than 12 buy ratings from analysts including an Overweight rating from Cantor Fitzgerald and a price target of $230.”
While others are still running from TSLA on fear, it’s time to buy that fear.
Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF ( DRIV )
Global X Funds logo. (PRNewsFoto/Global X Funds)
Or, if you want greater exposure autonomous and electric vehicle (EV) stocks at less cost, look at the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (NASDAQ: DRIV ).
The last time I highlighted opportunity in the DRIV ETF, it traded at $23.22 on April. Now at $24.70, it could potentially test $27 next. From here, if EV sales momentum can improve; if we see more charging stations installed; and if the Federal Reserve does cut interest rates, electric vehicle stocks and ETFs, like DRIV could accelerate to higher highs.
That is, if it can break above strong, current resistance at $25.  With an expense ratio of 0.68%, the ETF currently invests in 45 stocks involved in the development of autonomous vehicle technology, electric vehicles and EV components and materials.
Some of its top holdings include Nvidia, Toyota (NYSE: TM ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Tesla, and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) to name a few.

2024-05-20,"Fed Trader Talks TLT, Nvidia Bullishness, Tesla Bearishness And Bitcoin Neutrality","Fed Trader's Chaim Siegel believes that the fundamentals of the market, including earnings and the economy, are good and that the market will continue to be bullish.
He sees the Fed's stance on interest rates and inflation as key drivers for the market, and believes that as long as inflation remains around 0.3%, the market will be fine.
Siegel is bullish on Nvidia as a key player in the AI industry, but bearish on Tesla due to slowing revenues and lower margins. He believes Tesla needs to figure out Full Self-Driving to drive future growth.

Rena Sherbill: Chaim Siegel, welcome back to Investing Experts. It's always great to have you on Seeking Alpha. Thanks for making the time and talking to us.
Chaim Siegel: My pleasure. Thank you, Rena.
RS : Yes, it's a pleasure to have you on. You've been on before. The listeners know you. You run Fed Trader . Oftentimes, you're on here talking about macro topics. Sometimes, you're on here talking about stock-specific topics.
Here we are in the, almost the middle of the year. We're in the middle of May 2024. You were talking about how you were going to be bullish with some caveats at the very beginning of -- or at the end of last year, you were talking about this year. How are you thinking about the markets based on how you were seeing them previously, and how are you thinking about them currently?
CS : Yeah. So, thank you for having me. It's always a pleasure. I just want to backtrack, and I don't think I'm doing something so fancy or anything. I think I'm just doing basic pro-trader look at the market, markets moving up, markets moving down, and keeping things simple based on a few simple data and facts that I constantly follow. And sometimes, I feel like the market gets swayed by the media or different news.
And I think that there's a couple of building blocks. I'm just getting to your question, a couple of building blocks that can keep you sane in following the market and not get you crazy. One is fundamentals. Two is technicals. And maybe under technicals, or maybe its own category, I call action. So, fundamentals, are earnings moving up? Is the economy doing well, right? That's its own thing. Is the Fed getting in the way or not? Or is the Fed letting the economy go? That's all called fundamentals, right?...",4

2024-05-20,Why Taiwan Semiconductor Stock Is an Unstoppable Juggernaut to Bet On,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
There is no stopping Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM ). The world’s largest pure play semiconductor foundry really has too much demand for its capacity and will be flush with growth for years to come. Despite the excess of good fortune showering down on Taiwan Semiconductor stock, shares are not overvalued.
TSM stock is undervalued, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 20 and a sales multiple of less than 2. With sales growing at 16.5% CAGR and earnings at 18% CAGR, this is a discounted stock. Wall Street predicts Taiwan Semiconductor to surpass earnings growth, with a 21% CAGR. The stock has already risen 46% in 2024, indicating further growth potential.
A Closer Look at Taiwan Semiconductor Stock
There is no getting around it; Taiwan Semiconductor stock is a behemoth. It supplies 95% of all advanced semiconductors on the market and is the primary supplier to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), as well as other voracious chip consumers.
There are concerns of an imminent slump in the industry after several years of gorging because of artificial intelligence. Chinese foundry Semiconductor Manufacturing International says it will be limiting its capacity expansion in 2025 and beyond as chip prices are expected to fall and customer pre-pull, according to DigiTimes Asia .
Taiwan Semiconductor doesn’t disagree. It recently implied a slowdown was coming to the industry. However, it says its own business won’t be disrupted .
The chipmaker forecasts sales to keep growing in the “low- to mid-20%” range because CEO C.C. Wei says AI demand is “insatiable.” AI will account for low-teen percentages of revenue.
There is also the expansion in the number of companies wanting to make their own chips. Apple, for example, recently said it wants to make computer chips for data centers that are designed to run AI software .
Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) also want to build their own chips. But “build” is a misnomer. It will be TSM that actually makes most of the chips for their designs. So it will have no shortage of business regardless of what is happening elsewhere in the market.
Getting Paid to Expand
While chipmakers like Intel are big beneficiaries of the taxpayer dollars being doled out to massively profitable corporations through the U.S. CHIPS Act, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is also a big winner.
It is investing $65 billion in three new chip factories in Arizona. The first one is scheduled to begin producing 4 nanometer chips beginning in 2025.
A second facility will produce the world’s most advanced 2nm chips starting in 2028, and TSM will get a $25 billion handout from the federal government to build its third factory with production starting in 2030.
Not that there won’t be hiccups. The second plant, for example, is temporarily on hold due to rising costs as inflation keeps charging ahead.
TSM also discovered there is a lack of skilled labor in Arizona that is making it difficult to fill positions at the plant. That won’t get any easier if and when it builds its third factory.
Ascending to a $1 Trillion Valuation
Despite some challenges, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing just keeps growing in size and importance. It also means TSM stock will likely cross the trillion-dollar valuation threshold soon.
The company is currently valued at $790 billion, and with its growth trajectory firmly established, it won’t be long before it joins that elite group of stocks worth $1 trillion or more. Now would be a good time to climb aboard this rocket ride.

Although Apple shares are only down a modest 1.5% as of this writing, the company's latest earnings signal that further losses could be on the horizon.
Apple is one of the most innovative companies of all time. From the iPad to the iPhone, it has put on a decades-long master class in developing hit consumer electronics.
However, in recent years, one of the biggest knocks against the company has been its lack of innovation . Although the company introduced its Vision Pro virtual reality headset earlier this year, demand has been uninspiring as consumers have less expensive alternatives -- namely, from Meta Platforms .",5

2024-05-19,3 Reasons to Buy Apple Stock Like There's No Tomorrow,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) investors have been on a roller coaster in recent years, with an economic downturn bringing the iPhone maker's stock plunging 27% in 2022. The company's shares rebounded 48% the following year. However, repeated hits to its business and revenue declines throughout 2023 have seen its stock dip 1% since the start of this year.
Wall Street has grown wary of Apple's iPhone-dependent business as macroeconomic headwinds caught up with the company, leading to a decline in product sales. However, recent quarterly results and moves to prioritize more digital businesses suggest the company is moving in a better direction.
Apple's digital services segment consistently outpaces the iPhone and is on track to become its highest-earning division. Meanwhile, a gradual expansion into artificial intelligence (AI) could see the company profit from the tailwinds of a $200 billion (and growing) industry for years. As a result, now could be the best time to invest in Apple, as it is at the start of a major shift in its business model.",5

For those who haven’t picked out their Dow 40,000 hats, it’s okay. Yesterday marked the first day ever the Dow Jones Industrial Index pushed above the 40,000 level . It seems like just yesterday we were celebrating 30,000, but alas, that’s a bull market for you.
Today, the Dow Jones is up another 0.2%, within spitting distance of closing above this level. The 40,000 level for this index is a key psychological one , with traders positioning their portfolios accordingly. Higher index levels have been driven by large-cap performance (as is the case with other indices), though the makeup of the Dow is considerably different from the S&P 500 or Nasdaq .
With a focus on more industrial and blue-chip names, this index is often viewed as much more representative of the overall U.S. economy. If the market is gauging things right, perhaps that spells good times ahead.
Let’s dive into what to make of this move, and whether the Dow can end the year above this key level.
Put On Your Dow 40,000 Hats
We’ve yet to see a daily close above 40,000 on the Dow, so today’s price action will certainly be more closely watched by market pundits, traders and investors alike. Like any round number, many put outsized emphasis on where the Dow is currently trading and what may take this index to the 50,000 level down the road.
Consumer spending has remained strong, and the large-cap blue-chip stocks held in this index have certainly benefited from this trend. While less tech-heavy than other indices, it’s worth noting that the Dow does hold key mega-cap tech darlings such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), which happen to be the three largest Dow components by market capitalization.
So, this index isn’t immune to the artificial intelligence ( AI ) related catalysts taking the market higher but is more defensive in nature. It’s also more expensive to buy (via ETFs), meaning big money investors tend to focus on this index over others. That’s something that’s worth noting for retail investors looking to gain exposure to this space.
Over time, the stock market has historically headed higher, and I think it’s just a matter of time for us to celebrate 50,000 on the Dow. How long that will take is anyone’s guess, but this price action is certainly worth paying attention to today.
Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

2024-05-17,Rally Rockets: 3 Stocks Benefitting From the Market's Unstoppable Surge,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Major indices continue to climb Despite ongoing concerns over sticky inflation, high interest rates and geopolitical tensions. Many shares defy the traditional “sell in May and go away” adage. This trend leaves investors wondering which stocks to buy to ride the ongoing surge in equities.
Studies show that the S&P 500 Index has enjoyed 27 bull markets between 1928 and 2023, with an average gain of nearly 115% over an average period of 2.7 years. From 1987 to 2000, the longest bull market achieved an impressive gain of 582%. In June 2023, the S&P 500 re-entered bull market territory, displaying strong momentum. Research provider CFRA recently raised its 12-month target to over 5,600, citing optimistic profit growth expectations.
Although concerns persist about high valuations in the technology sector and the potential volatility surrounding the presidential election in November, market sentiment remains positive. Anticipated interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and earnings growth could create a favorable environment for further gains. Let’s explore three of the best stocks to buy, poised to benefit from the current market momentum.
Eli Lilly (LLY)
Source: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi
Pharma giant Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY ) provides medications across a wide range of therapeutic areas, including diabetes, cancer and chronic pain. Its strong product portfolio, consistent revenue growth, and potential for future breakthroughs make LLY stock the first name on our stock list.
For the first quarter of 2024 , Eli Lilly reported a remarkable 26% increase in revenue, primarily driven by the successful launch of new products like Mounjaro and Zepbound. Wall Street has been impressed with the pharma company’s ability to innovate and effectively bring new products to market.
Meanwhile, its gross margin also saw an impressive rise from 78.4% in the first quarter of 2023 to 82.5% in the first quarter of this year. Eli Lilly benefited from higher prices and an improved product mix, underscoring the company’s operational efficiency and pricing power. Operating income in the same period grew by 63%, and earnings per share increased by 59%. Looking ahead, Eli Lilly has raised its full-year 2024 revenue guidance to between $42.4 billion and $43.6 billion. The company also anticipates further margin expansion.
As a result, LLY stock has advanced 30% year-to-date (YTD), hovering slightly below all-time highs. Yet, the shares are expensive, trading at 56 times forward earnings and 19 times sales. Nonetheless, Wall Street is expecting further gains from the pharma stock , as the 12-month average price stands at $877.50 , presenting an upside potential of 15%.
Fabrinet (FN)
Source: Pixel B / Shutterstock.com
Next on our list of stocks to buy is Fabrinet (NYSE: FN ). Its equipment enables the transmission of massive data volumes at high speeds. With data demand constantly rising and a wide range of services ranging from optical packaging to precision manufacturing, Fabrinet deserves your attention as a long-term investment.
Analysts point out that Fabrinet has demonstrated robust financial health with a market cap of $8.4 billion. In early May, management released financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 . Exceeding guidance, quarterly revenue was $731.5 million, compared to $665.3 million for the same period 12 months ago. Adjusted net income per diluted share was $2.39, compared to $1.94 for the year-ago quarter.
Wall Street was pleased about the growth in optical communications revenues, particularly from datacom revenue, which grew 150% YOY. Management is optimistic about its position in the high data rate datacom market. Fabrinet’s operating and net profit margins currently stand at 9.6 and 9.9%, respectively. In other words, management has successfully navigated the competitive manufacturing landscape to maintain profitability.
Since the start of the year, FN stock has returned 22%, rallying significantly after announcing better-than-expected financial results. Meanwhile, the shares are trading at 26.2 times forward earnings and 3.1 times sales. Given the extent of the recent rally in Fabrinet shares, potential investors may consider waiting for a pullback towards the $220 level. Fabrinet will likely continue its growth trajectory in future quarters, making it a compelling stock to buy within the tech manufacturing sector.
Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG)

Large-cap growth stocks typically thrive in rapidly expanding industries like technology and biotech. Known for high growth rates and valuations, these companies are expected to outpace other established stocks. Such growth shares may offer a blend of stability and significant long-term potential, making them an important part of many portfolios.
Therefore, the Vanguard Growth ETF is next on our list of stocks to buy (NYSEARCA: VUG ). This fund allows investors to replicate the performance of leading large-cap U.S. growth stocks. Launched in January 2004, the ETF offers broad exposure to about 200 companies.
Over half of VUG’s holdings are in technology stocks (56%), followed by consumer discretionary (19%), industrials (9%) and healthcare (8%) sectors. The top 10 holdings collectively account for over half of the fund’s net assets of $226 billion. Among the top names are Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) (NASDAQ: GOOG ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) and Visa (NYSE: V ) and others.
Since January, with a gain of over 11%, VUG has outperformed many individual stocks and the benchmark indices. By comparison, the Nasdaq 100 index has advanced 9%, the S&P 500 10%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) 5%. Currently, the VUG fund trades at 38 times trailing earnings and 10 times book value. With a competitive expense ratio of 0.04% and a modest 0.5% dividend yield, VUG remains an appealing option for investors seeking exposure to large-cap growth stocks.

2024-05-17,Apple May Have 'Jumped The Shark' In Q2 - Here's A Put Option Opportunity,"As do many other investors, I see Apple's recent historic $110 billion buyback announcement as a sign of business weakness, not strength. Investors, so far, have cheered the announcement.
Serious competitive threats seem to be brewing, especially in Apple's largest market. These threats will likely spill beyond China's borders.
Major investment risks await shareholders at the beginning of November, and AAPL Put Options expiring November 15 look quite attractive. I'm specifically targeting the $170 Puts.
I'm a little surprised to see Apple ( AAPL ) (AAPL:CA) shares melt up after a short-term challenge following its post-Q2 spike, although this has been in concert with a generally rising market. With a moderately higher share price, amid subdued volatility (especially compared to the ~near earnings period), there may be an opportunity for those who have a developed a bearish view to consider Put Options at a strategic strike, and strategic expiry (carrying through the delivery of Q1 2025 guidance and the U.S. Presidential Election).

2024-05-16,Brace for a Market Crash With These 3 (Surprising) New Inflation Hedges,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
An inflation hedge protects against currency devaluation caused by rising prices. It involves investing in assets expected to maintain or increase value. Hedging can prevent investment losses due to inflation, which reduces the real return.
For instance, the real return is negative if a stock yields 5%, but inflation is 6%. Inflation-hedged assets may retain high value despite lower intrinsic worth as investors seek them out.
When people talk about their money not stretching as far, they’re referring to inflation affecting their earnings or wealth. Inflation reduces purchasing power, so individuals aim for earnings and investments to outpace it, allowing them to afford more, even with rising prices.
Each state has its own inflation rate, influenced by its economy and fiscal and monetary policies. Inflation can affect specific areas like gas or food costs and comes in three types: demand-pull, cost-push and built-in inflation.
That said, here are three new inflation hedges that people are going crazy about.
Nvidia Is the New Gold
One of the most traditional inflation hedges is gold. It has been a top inflation hedge since 1971; during the Great Recession, gold became so popular despite its volatility and short-term uncertainties. Banks believe that having more gold is better, and thus, they bought more of it in 2022 than in 1967.
Even in 2024, inflation is still an ongoing concern, and it has been causing delays in Fed rate cuts. As per Bloomberg, investors are turning to big tech stocks like the Magnificent Seven. However, gold remains the preferred inflation hedge.
In the latest Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey, respondents viewed significant U.S. tech stocks as a hedge against inflation alongside gold. At the same time, 46% favored gold and nearly a third chose tech giants.
Survey respondents favored tech giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) as the best hedge against inflation, highlighting their dominant role in the U.S. markets. Their steady profits and growth instill investor confidence in continued gains. Though reduced from 2022 highs, inflation still concerns investors, with 59% citing it as the top market risk. The following CPI reading is anticipated to sit at 3.4% year-over-year.
Three years ago, inflation skyrocketed past 2%, and Nvidia surged six times. Other tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) also outperformed the S&P 500 market by 50%. Although, like other tech stocks, they can be sensitive to inflation and changes in inflation rates.
In 2024, Nvidia marked a milestone and surged over 200%. The stock has exceeded $900 per share. In February, it awed the market through its excellent earnings report. The company showed $22 billion in revenue through generative AI and H100 GPUs. It also helped Nvidia get a seat at the trillion-dollar market cap hierarchy.
Investing in Farmlands
Institutional investors historically used agricultural land as an inflation hedge, but it must often be made available to most investors. In 2023, pension funds and tax-exempt vehicles held about 1,331 U.S. farmland properties worth $16.2 billion. Retail investors can access farmland assets through publicly traded REITs like Farmland Partners (NYSE: FPI ) and Gladstone Land (NASDAQ: LAND ).
Farmland historically performs well during high inflation due to its positive correlation and real asset nature. It correlates more strongly with the CPI and Producer Price Index than other investments. Real assets, including farmland, typically outperform traditional assets during inflation, with nominal value growth. Farmland has seen year-over-year price decreases only once since 1987, indicating value preservation despite inflation.
Farmland scarcity serves as a natural inflation hedge. The United States lost over 11 million acres in 20 years, and could still lead to more acres by 2050. Farmland proved otherwise, as it averaged an 11% annual return from years 1992 through 2020. It appreciates while generating operating cash flow, supported by the constant demand for food.
Farmland is a unique real estate investment that provides stable income and resilience across economic cycles. Moreover, the returns from farmland are not correlated with public markets. That makes them unaffected during economic shifts.
Although investing in farmland can be crucial due to decreasing arable land and global population, it is still worth an investment. In fact, regenerative agricultural practices make farmlands look enticing for investors.
Put Up a Chicken Wings Business
Chicken is reclaiming its place as a favorite food choice for Americans. With beef prices increasing, people are opting for more chicken wings at fast-food restaurants and frozen tenders at grocery stores. Meat companies like Tyson Foods (NYSE: TSN ) and Pilgrim’s Pride ( NASDAQ:PPC ) are seeing increased profits from poultry due to rising demand and lower costs for livestock feed.
Retail sales of all U.S. chicken products rose by 3% for the year ending April 21, while pork and beef sales slightly declined. With food spending at a three-decade high, consumers opt for cheaper private-label items and cut back on branded purchases. Tyson executives noted shoppers prioritizing essentials over beef and expensive brands, but the duration of this trend remains to be determined.
Moreover, unstable U.S. cattle supply leads meatpackers like Tyson to pay more for livestock, raising wholesale and retail meat prices. Tyson executives noted ranchers still need to begin rebuilding herds. Ground beef retail prices surged approximately 12% in March compared to a year ago, with Tyson’s CEO attributing strong chicken demand to more discerning consumers.
Fabio Sandri, CEO of Pilgrim’s Pride, noted a shift to cheaper chicken items on restaurant menus. Despite overall restaurant foot traffic declines, Pilgrim’s fast-food chain sales rose 6% in the latest quarter. Shares in the second-largest chicken processor surged approximately 60% over the past year.
Bottom Line
Inflation decreases purchasing power, limiting what one can buy with the same money. That may lead to borrowing or reduced spending on non-essential items. If one’s income keeps up with inflation, there’s less for investments or discretionary spending.
Additionally, inflation may trigger a recession by reducing consumer spending and prompting interest rate hikes to curb inflation, slowing borrowing and business activity.
Common inflation hedges include gold, commodities, a balanced 60/40 stock-to-bond portfolio, REITs, rental income, the S&P 500 and TIPS. Or, you may also want to invest more in Nvidia, farmlands or perhaps put up a chicken wing business while it’s cheap.

Burry's positions are in the Sprott Physical Gold Trust, which allows investors to take delivery of the gold if they buy enough.
Burry bought for a discount and now can sell for close to NAV thanks to the publicity from his 13-F - if he didn't already take delivery.

Exploring different ways to buy gold.
Quarterly 13-F reports came out this week, requiring institutional investors with more than $100 million in assets to disclose their holdings as of the end of Q1. 13-F reports offer a window into the portfolios of investing legends like Warren Buffett, Bill Ackman and Michael Burry (of The Big Short fame). I'm fascinated with these because the only time valuations were higher than now for large-cap US stocks was the late 1990s tech bubble. Buffett sold some Apple ( AAPL ) and bought Chubb ( CB ), Ackman bought nothing, and Burry disclosed that his biggest purchase was a physical gold fund ( PHYS ). As far as famous hedge fund managers go, Burry is the most flexible of the bunch because of his small AUM and willingness to think outside the box. So why would Burry be interested in gold?

2024-05-16,Shiny Apple? 3 Reasons to Buy and Hold AAPL Stock Forever.,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) saw a 5% decline in 2024, with shares of AAPL stock trading roughly flat on a year-to-date basis. Now, much of this performance has to do with Apple’s recent surge, with the stock dropping more than 15% peak to trough during this year’s decline.
There are ample reasons for investor pessimism towards Apple currently. The company has refreshed some product lines, but it’s uncertain if consumers will feel the need to buy the new iPhone. Negative growth in recent quarters may deter value investors from trading this stock, which is priced at nearly 30-times earnings.
That said, there’s a reason Apple remains a top tech stock investors continue to pile into. The company’s $110 billion share buyback plan boosted stock last week, signaling confidence despite the premium valuation.
Let’s dive into a few other reasons investors remain bulled up on this megacap tech name.
OpenAI and AAPL Stock
Apple appears to be nearing a deal with OpenAI for its iPhone AI technology, causing AAPL stock to rise Monday. Apple aims to integrate this technology into iOS 18, details of which will be unveiled at WWDC starting June 10.
Bloomberg reported Friday that Apple finalized terms to integrate OpenAI’s ChatGPT into iOS 18. Apple also discussed licensing Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: GOOG ) Google’s Gemini AI chatbot. CEO Tim Cook also noted the company’s transformative AI plans during its May 2 conference call.
Wedbush Securities’ Daniel Ives noted adding AI to the iPhone 16 series could drive upgrades. He suggested Apple might monetize AI services through subscriptions, leveraging its vast hardware user base.
Ives anticipated Apple enhancing Siri with OpenAI for complex tasks, potentially as a separate subscription service.
Apple Quartiles
Apple News+ also introduced Quartiles , a new original spelling game, and Offline Mode for subscribers without Wi-Fi or cellular. Available with iOS 17.5, these enhance the News+ experience. Editor-in-chief Lauren Kern highlighted the additions’ convenience and entertainment value.
Quartiles challenges players to create words from tiles with 2 to 4 letters, earning points based on word length. New puzzles are offered daily, and users can share puzzles with other subscribers.
It’s the latest addition to News+’s Puzzles collection. With iOS 17, Apple introduced daily crosswords and mini puzzles for U.S. and Canadian subscribers. A new Puzzles Scoreboard allows subscribers to view personalized stats and streaks.
Possible Partnership with Rivian
On May 6, reports suggested Apple was exploring a partnership, with EV company Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN ) emerging as a top candidate. Although details remain speculative, a collaboration could significantly benefit both companies.
Apple invested $10 billion over a decade in its EV project but scrapped it in early 2024 after multiple failed attempts. With cars becoming advanced computers, Apple sees a chance to diversify its ecosystem and enter the automotive space by partnering with Rivian.
Rivian, struggling financially and losing over $38,000 per car, could benefit from Apple’s brand recognition and expertise, potentially opening new opportunities in the competitive EV market.
A Rivian-Apple collaboration could focus on joint R&D in autonomous driving technology. Rivian’s Driver+ software, requiring driver attention, could benefit from Apple’s financial and technological resources, accelerating progress toward Level 4 or 5 autonomy.
Rivian has the hardware and infrastructure for vehicle production, while Apple could develop the software, making their partnership highly complementary.
AAPL Stock Isn’t Cheap, But for a Reason
Apple’s quarterly results highlighted a historic buyback and sluggish iPhone sales, especially in China. Despite economic challenges and competition, Cook remains optimistic.
While the iPhone faces competition in China, innovations could lead to a resurgence. Overall, Apple’s solid quarter suggests potential for stock growth.
I think long-term investors who have owned AAPL stock forever may simply want to continue holding. While the stock’s valuation is excessive, it’s also true that this is a company that’s worth the premium.
On a capital return basis alone, Apple certainly remains one of the best companies in the world. I don’t think that will change over the next decade.

2024-05-16,3 Warren Buffett Stocks That Look Irresistible Right Now,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B ) portfolio is rich with what the Oracle of Omaha would refer to as “wonderful” businesses. Though Berkshire’s portfolio has skewed away from technology stocks in prior decades, one can’t help but notice that the modern-day Berkshire portfolio has pivoted towards the modern age.
And we’re not just talking about the conglomerate’s massive stake in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Aside from the iPhone maker, which still comprises a huge portion of the overall Berkshire portfolio, even after trimming by 13%, Berkshire owns a sprinkling (less than 1%) in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ).
Apart from Berkshire’s tech-savvy bets, many other holdings within the Berkshire portfolio always stand to gain a lot by investing in technological initiatives. Most notably, American Express (NYSE: AXP ) stands out as a firm that’s equipped to thrive in the data-driven age with its analytics capabilities.
In this piece, we’ll examine three Warren Buffett stocks that look irresistible as they embrace tech to boost long-term growth.
American Express (AXP)

American Express is one of the older holdings within the Berkshire portfolio. Still, unlike other older Berkshire investments that have dragged their feet on the returns front of late, the premier credit card firm has continued to deliver impressive gains. Year-to-date, AXP stock is up more than 28%, thanks in part to some amazing quarters that shot past analyst expectations.
Consumer sentiment could easily get choppier from here as inflation’s impact continues to weigh. That said, American Express looks poised to continue posting solid numbers, as its “spend-centric” model keeps flexing its muscles, even in the face of high inflation and macro headwinds that stand to impact global spending.
Well-of Amex cardholders and spend-happy Millennials, some of whom were brought on just in the past year, do not look to be putting their cards away. As they continue buying a wide range of goods with their Gold and Platinum cards at 2024-era prices, AXP stock certainly stands out as one of the better inflation-fighting stocks in the market. Higher prices on just about everything translate into larger tabs on one’s monthly Amex bill.
Further, given its recent resilience and continued investments in digital transformation, AXP stock still seems a tad undervalued at less than 20 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E).
Visa (V)
Source: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com
Visa (NYSE: V ) is a much smaller holding in the Berkshire portfolio at less than 1% at the time of writing. Indeed, Berkshire and Buffett seem to be fans of the credit card business, and it’s not a mystery as to why. Though V stock hasn’t been nearly as hot, up 7.3%, trailing the market by about 3%, I do view the leading credit card company as worth pursuing after its recent roadbump.
Recently, Piper Sandler started V stock with an overweight rating . The company’s impressive network, which has high barriers to entry around it (a wide economic moat), and tech prowess were major reasons why Piper is a fan of the stock.
Most notably, Piper outlined the potential for generative AI to help “drive upside to fundamentals.” Undoubtedly, Visa is as much a financial technology company as it is a creditcard firm. And you can bet it’s taking generative AI seriously as it seeks to gain any operating or growth edge it can get.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com
Finally, we have the number-one holding in Berkshire’s public stock portfolio. Investors and Buffett followers have plenty of reasons to buy the stock, even if Berkshire is inclined to continue trimming in the near future.
The rest of 2024 could see Apple’s most aggressive push into generative AI yet, with the WWDC24 to begin on June 10, 2024 . Reports suggest the annual multi-day conference could be heavy on generative AI.
Whether it’s as heavy on AI as Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , GOOGL ) Google’s recent I/O 2024 event remains to be seen. Regardless, I’m quite bullish on Apple’s near-term future as it looks to bring the AI tech up a notch for its coming iOS 18. With a ChatGPT deal reportedly close to being inked, AAPL stock may have enough drivers to take it right back to all-time highs of close to $198 per share by year’s end.
At 29.15 times trailing P/E, AAPL stock is getting somewhat frothy again. I view the multiple as worth paying if it means that Siri is going to get a heck of a lot smarter.

2024-05-15,Buffett's Billion-Dollar Biz: 3 Crucial Takeaways From Berkshire's Q1 Results,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
It’s been nearly two weeks since Warren Buffett presided over his company’s annual shareholder meeting in Omaha. The ritual has become a must-attend for those in the industry and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B ) shareholders. There’s no question Berkshire Hathaway stock remains very attractive for long-term investors.
The media’s gone over many of the highlights, so I won’t delve into the events of that weekend in Nebraska. It sounded, as always, like a lot of fun. The biggest downer: Charlie Munger wasn’t there to throw out the usual zingers he’s become known for. Munger will be remembered for years to come.
I’ve always felt that Berkshire is the ultimate mutual fund. This is because it charges no fees, provides healthy long-term returns, and protects against the downside. You will find that this is unlike few stocks in the United States.
If you could only own one stock, besides the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA: SPY ), which Buffett recommends most investors buy, it would be Berkshire Hathaway.
Drawing from the company’s Q1 2024 results, here are three reasons.
It’s a Team Game with Berkshire Hathaway Stock
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
The one thing I love about Berkshire is that it’s like a sports team in that there’s always somebody performing well to drag the rest of the team along, even when they don’t want to. They all sink or swim together.
In the latest quarter, its operating earnings were $11.2 billion , 4o% higher than a year earlier. That’s the figure to look at when studying the company’s quarterly and annual reports.
If you use net earnings, you’ll get wild swings in the results due to investment gains and losses (realized and unrealized) that must be reported each quarter. In Q1 2024, its net earnings were $12.70 billion, 64% lower than a year ago.
There are seven items that make up operating earnings. In the first quarter, BNSF, the company’s railroad business, had operating earnings that were 8.3% lower than a year earlier. The only other item with a decrease was its investments in companies where it doesn’t control a majority, owning between 20% and 50%. Those earnings were almost 29% lower year-over-year.
The good news is these two businesses only accounted for less than 14% of its operating earnings.
There will come a day when both of these businesses outperform their five other stablemates, likely when they are most needed to keep overall earnings growing.
Buffett Sold Apple for a Couple of Reasons
Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com
Berkshire’s Q1 2024 results showed that the company cut its stake in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) by about 13% in the first quarter to 790 million shares. While that’s a significant reduction, it still leaves the company with shares accounting for 40.2% of its $367 million equity portfolio. That’s four times its next largest holding — Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) at 10.9%.
The first reason sold some of its Apple stock was to get more cash. With interest rates still high and stocks overvalued — Apple trades at 28x earnings compared to a multiple between 12 and 20 times earnings when Berkshire acquired most of its AAPL stock — the interest it earns on its $189 billion cash pile is a real incentive to lock-in some gains on its Apple stock.
Who knows? He might buy some more if it drops in the future. However, Berkshire shareholders ought to be happy that he’s lowered the overweight weight Apple has on the entire company’s assets.
Diversification when you’ve got a great team is not a bad thing.
Buffett’s Getting a Faster Trigger Finger
How many years did it take the company to jump off the Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ) bandwagon after it became patently clear that the bank had a broken business model that it is just now getting over the scandals that plagued the company.
In February, the Office of the Controller of the Currency ( OCC ) terminated its consent order , first implemented in September 2016, that forced the company to clean up its act over its sales practices.
“Confirmation from the OCC that we have effectively implemented what was required is a result of the hard work of so many of our employees, and I’d like to thank everyone at Wells Fargo involved for their dedication to transforming how we do business,” stated CEO Peter Scharf in a prepared statement.
Berkshire sold off the last of WFC shares in Q1 2022 , six years after the OCC’s consent orcder went into effect. That’s a long time to stand by a company.
In the case of Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA ), he had no such patience. He said at the annual meeting that he alone decided to sell its entire stake in the troubled firm, crystallizing a significant capital loss for the company.
On the one hand, it’s never good to take a loss. On the other hand, it has significant unrealized gains on its equity portfolio — $232.1 billion at the end of March — to offset these gains.
We don’t know if Buffett was behind the buy but he had no problem taking responsibility for the sale. That’s what you want in an investment manager. The ability to move on when you’ve made a mistake.

Even amidst macroeconomic headwinds, the S&P 500 index has remained resilient. For the year-to-date, the index has trended higher by 10%. While it’s good to remain optimistic, preparing for the worst is equally important. I don’t intend to be a fearmonger and it’s unlikely that there will be a big crash. However, even a 10% to 15% correction in the index is significant. To remain prepared for any such scenario, this column intends to discuss some low-risk, high-reward stocks to buy and hold.
It’s first important to understand the reason for remaining cautious. GDP growth decelerated in Q1 2024, and this calls for rate cuts. However, with stubborn inflation, the Fed will likely be slow in pursuing expansionary policies. Fear of a hard landing will likely be the catalyst for a market correction.
The first-rate cut is likely before the Presidential elections. Therefore, any weakness in the market would be an opportunity to accumulate quality stocks. For now, let’s discuss three low-risk, high-reward stocks to buy.
Panasonic Holdings (PCRFY)

In my view, Panasonic Holdings (OTCMKTS: PCRFY ) stock is a low-risk bet for two reasons. First, PCRFY stock has already been oversold and has mainly remained sideways in the last 12 months. Considering a forward price-earnings ratio of 8.5, I don’t see a downside from current levels for this 1.26% dividend yield stock.
Further, Panasonic Holdings is among the major players in the EV battery market. The company is high on innovation and has ambitious expansion plans through 2031. Once industry sentiments change, PCRFY stock is likely to deliver multibagger returns.
In terms of expansion plans, Panasonic is targeting to boost its EV battery manufacturing capacity to 200GWh by 2031. This will translate into steady revenue growth coupled with EBITDA margin expansion.
On the innovation front, Panasonic has partnered with Sila Nanotechnologies to “purchase next-generation nano-composite silicon anode material for EV lithium-ion batteries.” By 2031, Panasonic aims to achieve a 25% increase in battery energy density. With all these positives, it’s a good time to buy PCRFY stock.
Apple (AAPL)

The last few quarters have been mixed for technology stocks . Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) stock has surged 215% in the previous 12 months. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock has remained sideways during the same period. In my view, investors can consider some allocation to innovation driven ideas that have remained subdued. Apple is possibly among the best names to consider.
An important point to note is that the application of AI is being talked about across sectors. AI is expected to contribute $15 trillion to the global economy by 2030. I believe the markets are waiting for Apple’s big AI push. Once that’s clear, AAPL stock is likely to surge higher.
Apple ended Q2 2024 with $161 billion in cash and equivalents . This provides ample flexibility to invest in next-generation technology for its devices. Apple has already been making small acquisitions in the AI space. In another recent news, Apple is planning to sell its Vision Pro mixed-reality headset outside the United States. The wearable and services segment has ample scope for growth in the coming years.
Vale (VALE)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
Among blue-chip commodity stocks, Vale (NYSE: VALE ) is worth buying at current levels of $12.5. VALE stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 5.2, indicatinghe extent of undervaluation. The stock also offers an attractive dividend yield of 8.8%.
Regarding potential returns, analysts have a median price target of $16 for the stock. This would imply an upside of 28% from current levels. Therefore, the total return from VALE stock is likely at 35% to 40% in the next 12 months, with valuations indicating limited downside risk.
Vale will benefit from relatively higher iron ore prices from a business perspective. A possible rate cut towards the end of the year can trigger a rally for industrial commodities. This will support revenue and adjust EBITDA upside.
It’s worth noting that for Q1 2024, Vale reported the highest quarterly iron ore production since 2019. Copper and nickel production also witnessed healthy growth. If this trend is sustained, the company will be positioned to deliver strong free cash flows.

2024-05-15,2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever,"Choosing stocks that you never have to sell has enormous advantages. If you choose well, it means you can let the investment compound in value for potentially decades. As Warren Buffett knows all too well, uninterrupted compound interest is the best way to build lasting wealth.
Since 1965, Buffett's investing skills have steered Berkshire Hathaway 's shares to an awe-inspiring return of 4,384,748% through 2023. A key component of those returns was selected investments in stocks of strong companies in its $300-plus-billion equity portfolio. Let's look at two of its top stock holdings that can grow for decades.
Warren Buffett has a long history of betting big on strong consumer brands. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has a loyal customer base that is willing to give up many other things before their iPhones. The stock has returned 531% since Berkshire first started buying the stock in 2016, which brought its stake to a value of $174 billion at the end of 2023.",6

2024-05-15,Berkshire Hathaway Stock Alert: Warren Buffett Could Reveal His Mystery Buy Today,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Conglomerate giant Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A , NYSE: BRK-B ) – which covers a broad range of sectors from insurance to utilities – saw its shares grab the spotlight on Wednesday. Speculation has heightened around a confidential position that Warren Buffett’s enterprise acquired at some point in the second half of 2023. With the disclosure deadline today, the Warren Buffett mystery stock could be revealed soon.
According to Investor’s Business Daily , the conglomerate previously stated during its Q1 earnings report that it reduced a significant position in consumer technology giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) by 13%. It also exited multinational mass media firm Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA ). However, not all of the moves were revealed publicly, which could come in a 13F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) late Wednesday.
The spotlight centers on the so-called Berkshire Hathaway mystery stock. Several Buffett watchers speculate that the security may relate to a financial firm. Per Edward Jones analyst James Shanahan, it could be Charles Schwab (NYSE: SCHW ), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) or American International Group (NYSE: AIG ).
Business publication Barron’s added its own possible candidates for the Berkshire Hathaway mystery stock. Besides Morgan Stanley, it identified BlackRock (NYSE: BLK ) or Chubb (NYSE: CB ). “The mystery company or companies probably are in the financial sector because the cost basis of Berkshire’s equity holdings in financial stocks has risen by about $5 billion in the past three quarters and declined for two other categories of stocks,” wrote Barron’s Andrew Bary.
Not the First Rodeo Regarding a Berkshire Hathaway Mystery Stock
Institutional stakeholders of U.S.-based securities reveal their positions in 13F disclosures. However, according to the SEC website, these investors have the option of requesting confidential treatment . That’s exactly what Berkshire did regarding its Q4 filing.
While interest has spiked regarding the Berkshire Hathaway mystery stock, this isn’t the first time the conglomerate has requested such treatment. In late 2020, Berkshire requested confidentiality when it was acquiring shares of Chevron (NYSE: CVX ) and Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ).
However, to Barron’s point, the “company makes use of confidential filings more than other big investors.” It then raises the question about the significance of the Berkshire Hathaway mystery stock in relation to the conglomerate’s strategy.
According to a research paper submitted to the Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis , entities may choose to keep their trades quiet because “confidential positions earn positive and significant abnormal returns over the post-filing confidential period.”
In other words, confidential investments tend to perform better relative to normal market expectations. Therefore, keeping the cards close to the chest may better protect proprietary investing strategies.
Why It Matters
It’s not out of the realm of possibility that Berkshire could request another quarter of confidential treatment. However, Barron’s states that such a circumstance would be unusual. Should the disclosure come later today, the conglomerate will likely amend its filings for Q3 and Q4 to include the much-discussed security.

2024-05-15,"Apple announces new accessibility features, including Eye Tracking, Music Haptics, and Vocal Shortcuts","Apple® today announced new accessibility features coming later this year, including Eye Tracking, a way for users with physical disabilities to control iPad® or iPhone® with their eyes. Additionally, Music Haptics will offer a new way for users who are deaf or hard of hearing to experience music using the Taptic Engine® in iPhone; Vocal Shortcuts will allow users to perform tasks by making a custom sound; Vehicle Motion Cues can help reduce motion sickness when using iPhone or iPad in a moving vehicle; and more accessibility features will come to visionOS™. These features combine the power of Apple hardware and software, harnessing Apple silicon, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to further Apple’s decades-long commitment to designing products for everyone.
“We believe deeply in the transformative power of innovation to enrich lives,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “That’s why for nearly 40 years, Apple has championed inclusive design by embedding accessibility at the core of our hardware and software. We’re continuously pushing the boundaries of technology, and these new features reflect our long-standing commitment to delivering the best possible experience to all of our users.”
“Each year, we break new ground when it comes to accessibility,” said Sarah Herrlinger, Apple’s senior director of Global Accessibility Policy and Initiatives. “These new features will make an impact in the lives of a wide range of users, providing new ways to communicate, control their devices, and move through the world.”
Eye Tracking Comes to iPad and iPhone
Powered by artificial intelligence, Eye Tracking gives users a built-in option for navigating iPad and iPhone with just their eyes. Designed for users with physical disabilities, Eye Tracking uses the front-facing camera to set up and calibrate in seconds, and with on-device machine learning, all data used to set up and control this feature is kept securely on device, and isn’t shared with Apple.
Eye Tracking works across iPadOS® and iOS apps, and doesn’t require additional hardware or accessories. With Eye Tracking, users can navigate through the elements of an app and use Dwell Control to activate each element, accessing additional functions such as physical buttons, swipes, and other gestures solely with their eyes.
Music Haptics Makes Songs More Accessible
Music Haptics is a new way for users who are deaf or hard of hearing to experience music on iPhone. With this accessibility feature turned on, the Taptic Engine in iPhone plays taps, textures, and refined vibrations to the audio of the music. Music Haptics works across millions of songs in the Apple Music® catalog, and will be available as an API for developers to make music more accessible in their apps.
New Features for a Wide Range of Speech
With Vocal Shortcuts, iPhone and iPad users can assign custom utterances that Siri® can understand to launch shortcuts and complete complex tasks. Listen for Atypical Speech, another new feature, gives users an option for enhancing speech recognition for a wider range of speech. Listen for Atypical Speech uses on-device machine learning to recognize user speech patterns. Designed for users with acquired or progressive conditions that affect speech, such as cerebral palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or stroke, these features provide a new level of customization and control, building on features introduced in iOS 17 for users who are nonspeaking or at risk of losing their ability to speak.
“Artificial intelligence has the potential to improve speech recognition for millions of people with atypical speech, so we are thrilled that Apple is bringing these new accessibility features to consumers,” said Mark Hasegawa-Johnson, the Speech Accessibility Project at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign’s principal investigator. “The Speech Accessibility Project was designed as a broad-based, community-supported effort to help companies and universities make speech recognition more robust and effective, and Apple is among the accessibility advocates who made the Speech Accessibility Project possible.”
Vehicle Motion Cues Can Help Reduce Motion Sickness
Vehicle Motion Cues is a new experience for iPhone and iPad that can help reduce motion sickness for passengers in moving vehicles. Research shows that motion sickness is commonly caused by a sensory conflict between what a person sees and what they feel, which can prevent some users from comfortably using iPhone or iPad while riding in a moving vehicle. With Vehicle Motion Cues, animated dots on the edges of the screen represent changes in vehicle motion to help reduce sensory conflict without interfering with the main content. Using sensors built into iPhone and iPad, Vehicle Motion Cues recognizes when a user is in a moving vehicle and responds accordingly. The feature can be set to show automatically on iPhone, or can be turned on and off in Control Center.
CarPlay Gets Voice Control, More Accessibility Updates
Accessibility features coming to CarPlay® include Voice Control, Color Filters, and Sound Recognition. With Voice Control, users can navigate CarPlay and control apps with just their voice. With Sound Recognition, drivers or passengers who are deaf or hard of hearing can turn on alerts to be notified of car horns and sirens. For users who are colorblind, Color Filters make the CarPlay interface visually easier to use, with additional visual accessibility features including Bold Text and Large Text.
Accessibility Features Coming to visionOS
This year, accessibility features coming to visionOS will include systemwide Live Captions to help everyone — including users who are deaf or hard of hearing — follow along with spoken dialogue in live conversations and in audio from apps. With Live Captions for FaceTime® in visionOS, more users can easily enjoy the unique experience of connecting and collaborating using their Persona. Apple Vision Pro™ will add the capability to move captions using the window bar during Apple Immersive Video, as well as support for additional Made for iPhone hearing devices and cochlear hearing processors. Updates for vision accessibility will include the addition of Reduce Transparency, Smart Invert, and Dim Flashing Lights for users who have low vision, or those who want to avoid bright lights and frequent flashing.
These features join the dozens of accessibility features already available in Apple Vision Pro, which offers a flexible input system and an intuitive interface designed with a wide range of users in mind. Features such as VoiceOver, Zoom, and Color Filters can also provide users who are blind or have low vision access to spatial computing, while features such as Guided Access can support users with cognitive disabilities. Users can control Vision Pro with any combination of their eyes, hands, or voice, with accessibility features including Switch Control, Sound Actions, and Dwell Control that can also help those with physical disabilities.
“Apple Vision Pro is without a doubt the most accessible technology I’ve ever used,” said Ryan Hudson-Peralta, a Detroit-based product designer, accessibility consultant, and cofounder of Equal Accessibility LLC. “As someone born without hands and unable to walk, I know the world was not designed with me in mind, so it’s been incredible to see that visionOS just works. It’s a testament to the power and importance of accessible and inclusive design.”
Additional Updates
For users who are blind or have low vision, VoiceOver will include new voices, a flexible Voice Rotor, custom volume control, and the ability to customize VoiceOver keyboard shortcuts on Mac®.
Magnifier will offer a new Reader Mode and the option to easily launch Detection Mode with the Action button.
Braille users will get a new way to start and stay in Braille Screen Input for faster control and text editing; Japanese language availability for Braille Screen Input; support for multi-line braille with Dot Pad ; and the option to choose different input and output tables.

For users at risk of losing their ability to speak, Personal Voice will be available in Mandarin Chinese. Users who have difficulty pronouncing or reading full sentences will be able to create a Personal Voice using shortened phrases.
For users who are nonspeaking, Live Speech will include categories and simultaneous compatibility with Live Captions .
For users with physical disabilities, Virtual Trackpad for AssistiveTouch® allows users to control their device using a small region of the screen as a resizable trackpad.
Switch Control will include the option to use the cameras in iPhone and iPad to recognize finger-tap gestures as switches.
Voice Control will offer support for custom vocabularies and complex words.

Serious competitive threats seem to be brewing, especially in Apple's largest market. These threats will likely spill beyond China's borders.
Major investment risks await shareholders at the beginning of November, and AAPL Put Options expiring November 15 look quite attractive. I'm specifically targeting the $170 Puts.
I'm a little surprised to see Apple ( AAPL ) (AAPL:CA) shares melt up after a short-term challenge following its post-Q2 spike, although this has been in concert with a generally rising market. With a moderately higher share price, amid subdued volatility (especially compared to the ~near earnings period), there may be an opportunity for those who have a developed a bearish view to consider Put Options at a strategic strike, and strategic expiry (carrying through the delivery of Q1 2025 guidance and the U.S. Presidential Election). I'll detail that specific trade idea lower down.

2024-05-16,Brace for a Market Crash With These 3 (Surprising) New Inflation Hedges,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
An inflation hedge protects against currency devaluation caused by rising prices. It involves investing in assets expected to maintain or increase value. Hedging can prevent investment losses due to inflation, which reduces the real return.
For instance, the real return is negative if a stock yields 5%, but inflation is 6%. Inflation-hedged assets may retain high value despite lower intrinsic worth as investors seek them out.
When people talk about their money not stretching as far, they’re referring to inflation affecting their earnings or wealth. Inflation reduces purchasing power, so individuals aim for earnings and investments to outpace it, allowing them to afford more, even with rising prices.
Each state has its own inflation rate, influenced by its economy and fiscal and monetary policies. Inflation can affect specific areas like gas or food costs and comes in three types: demand-pull, cost-push and built-in inflation.
That said, here are three new inflation hedges that people are going crazy about.
Nvidia Is the New Gold
One of the most traditional inflation hedges is gold. It has been a top inflation hedge since 1971; during the Great Recession, gold became so popular despite its volatility and short-term uncertainties. Banks believe that having more gold is better, and thus, they bought more of it in 2022 than in 1967.
Even in 2024, inflation is still an ongoing concern, and it has been causing delays in Fed rate cuts. As per Bloomberg, investors are turning to big tech stocks like the Magnificent Seven. However, gold remains the preferred inflation hedge.
In the latest Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey, respondents viewed significant U.S. tech stocks as a hedge against inflation alongside gold. At the same time, 46% favored gold and nearly a third chose tech giants.
Survey respondents favored tech giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) as the best hedge against inflation, highlighting their dominant role in the U.S. markets. Their steady profits and growth instill investor confidence in continued gains. Though reduced from 2022 highs, inflation still concerns investors, with 59% citing it as the top market risk. The following CPI reading is anticipated to sit at 3.4% year-over-year.
Three years ago, inflation skyrocketed past 2%, and Nvidia surged six times. Other tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) also outperformed the S&P 500 market by 50%. Although, like other tech stocks, they can be sensitive to inflation and changes in inflation rates.
In 2024, Nvidia marked a milestone and surged over 200%. The stock has exceeded $900 per share. In February, it awed the market through its excellent earnings report. The company showed $22 billion in revenue through generative AI and H100 GPUs. It also helped Nvidia get a seat at the trillion-dollar market cap hierarchy.
Investing in Farmlands
Institutional investors historically used agricultural land as an inflation hedge, but it must often be made available to most investors. In 2023, pension funds and tax-exempt vehicles held about 1,331 U.S. farmland properties worth $16.2 billion. Retail investors can access farmland assets through publicly traded REITs like Farmland Partners (NYSE: FPI ) and Gladstone Land (NASDAQ: LAND ).
Farmland historically performs well during high inflation due to its positive correlation and real asset nature. It correlates more strongly with the CPI and Producer Price Index than other investments. Real assets, including farmland, typically outperform traditional assets during inflation, with nominal value growth. Farmland has seen year-over-year price decreases only once since 1987, indicating value preservation despite inflation.
Farmland scarcity serves as a natural inflation hedge. The United States lost over 11 million acres in 20 years, and could still lead to more acres by 2050. Farmland proved otherwise, as it averaged an 11% annual return from years 1992 through 2020. It appreciates while generating operating cash flow, supported by the constant demand for food.
Farmland is a unique real estate investment that provides stable income and resilience across economic cycles. Moreover, the returns from farmland are not correlated with public markets. That makes them unaffected during economic shifts.
Although investing in farmland can be crucial due to decreasing arable land and global population, it is still worth an investment. In fact, regenerative agricultural practices make farmlands look enticing for investors.
Put Up a Chicken Wings Business
Chicken is reclaiming its place as a favorite food choice for Americans. With beef prices increasing, people are opting for more chicken wings at fast-food restaurants and frozen tenders at grocery stores. Meat companies like Tyson Foods (NYSE: TSN ) and Pilgrim’s Pride ( NASDAQ:PPC ) are seeing increased profits from poultry due to rising demand and lower costs for livestock feed.
Retail sales of all U.S. chicken products rose by 3% for the year ending April 21, while pork and beef sales slightly declined. With food spending at a three-decade high, consumers opt for cheaper private-label items and cut back on branded purchases. Tyson executives noted shoppers prioritizing essentials over beef and expensive brands, but the duration of this trend remains to be determined.
Moreover, unstable U.S. cattle supply leads meatpackers like Tyson to pay more for livestock, raising wholesale and retail meat prices. Tyson executives noted ranchers still need to begin rebuilding herds. Ground beef retail prices surged approximately 12% in March compared to a year ago, with Tyson’s CEO attributing strong chicken demand to more discerning consumers.
Fabio Sandri, CEO of Pilgrim’s Pride, noted a shift to cheaper chicken items on restaurant menus. Despite overall restaurant foot traffic declines, Pilgrim’s fast-food chain sales rose 6% in the latest quarter. Shares in the second-largest chicken processor surged approximately 60% over the past year.
Bottom Line
Inflation decreases purchasing power, limiting what one can buy with the same money. That may lead to borrowing or reduced spending on non-essential items. If one’s income keeps up with inflation, there’s less for investments or discretionary spending.
Additionally, inflation may trigger a recession by reducing consumer spending and prompting interest rate hikes to curb inflation, slowing borrowing and business activity.
Common inflation hedges include gold, commodities, a balanced 60/40 stock-to-bond portfolio, REITs, rental income, the S&P 500 and TIPS. Or, you may also want to invest more in Nvidia, farmlands or perhaps put up a chicken wing business while it’s cheap.

Quarterly 13-F reports came out this week, requiring institutional investors with more than $100 million in assets to disclose their holdings as of the end of Q1. 13-F reports offer a window into the portfolios of investing legends like Warren Buffett, Bill Ackman and Michael Burry (of The Big Short fame). I'm fascinated with these because the only time valuations were higher than now for large-cap US stocks was the late 1990s tech bubble. Buffett sold some Apple ( AAPL ) and bought Chubb ( CB ), Ackman bought nothing, and Burry disclosed that his biggest purchase was a physical gold fund ( PHYS ). As far as famous hedge fund managers go, Burry is the most flexible of the bunch because of his small AUM and willingness to think outside the box. So why would Burry be interested in gold?

2024-05-16,Shiny Apple? 3 Reasons to Buy and Hold AAPL Stock Forever.,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) saw a 5% decline in 2024, with shares of AAPL stock trading roughly flat on a year-to-date basis. Now, much of this performance has to do with Apple’s recent surge, with the stock dropping more than 15% peak to trough during this year’s decline.
There are ample reasons for investor pessimism towards Apple currently. The company has refreshed some product lines, but it’s uncertain if consumers will feel the need to buy the new iPhone. Negative growth in recent quarters may deter value investors from trading this stock, which is priced at nearly 30-times earnings.
That said, there’s a reason Apple remains a top tech stock investors continue to pile into. The company’s $110 billion share buyback plan boosted stock last week, signaling confidence despite the premium valuation.
Let’s dive into a few other reasons investors remain bulled up on this megacap tech name.
OpenAI and AAPL Stock
Apple appears to be nearing a deal with OpenAI for its iPhone AI technology, causing AAPL stock to rise Monday. Apple aims to integrate this technology into iOS 18, details of which will be unveiled at WWDC starting June 10.
Bloomberg reported Friday that Apple finalized terms to integrate OpenAI’s ChatGPT into iOS 18. Apple also discussed licensing Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: GOOG ) Google’s Gemini AI chatbot. CEO Tim Cook also noted the company’s transformative AI plans during its May 2 conference call.
Wedbush Securities’ Daniel Ives noted adding AI to the iPhone 16 series could drive upgrades. He suggested Apple might monetize AI services through subscriptions, leveraging its vast hardware user base.
Ives anticipated Apple enhancing Siri with OpenAI for complex tasks, potentially as a separate subscription service.
Apple Quartiles
Apple News+ also introduced Quartiles , a new original spelling game, and Offline Mode for subscribers without Wi-Fi or cellular. Available with iOS 17.5, these enhance the News+ experience. Editor-in-chief Lauren Kern highlighted the additions’ convenience and entertainment value.
Quartiles challenges players to create words from tiles with 2 to 4 letters, earning points based on word length. New puzzles are offered daily, and users can share puzzles with other subscribers.
It’s the latest addition to News+’s Puzzles collection. With iOS 17, Apple introduced daily crosswords and mini puzzles for U.S. and Canadian subscribers. A new Puzzles Scoreboard allows subscribers to view personalized stats and streaks.
Possible Partnership with Rivian
On May 6, reports suggested Apple was exploring a partnership, with EV company Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN ) emerging as a top candidate. Although details remain speculative, a collaboration could significantly benefit both companies.
Apple invested $10 billion over a decade in its EV project but scrapped it in early 2024 after multiple failed attempts. With cars becoming advanced computers, Apple sees a chance to diversify its ecosystem and enter the automotive space by partnering with Rivian.
Rivian, struggling financially and losing over $38,000 per car, could benefit from Apple’s brand recognition and expertise, potentially opening new opportunities in the competitive EV market.
A Rivian-Apple collaboration could focus on joint R&D in autonomous driving technology. Rivian’s Driver+ software, requiring driver attention, could benefit from Apple’s financial and technological resources, accelerating progress toward Level 4 or 5 autonomy.
Rivian has the hardware and infrastructure for vehicle production, while Apple could develop the software, making their partnership highly complementary.
AAPL Stock Isn’t Cheap, But for a Reason
Apple’s quarterly results highlighted a historic buyback and sluggish iPhone sales, especially in China. Despite economic challenges and competition, Cook remains optimistic.
While the iPhone faces competition in China, innovations could lead to a resurgence. Overall, Apple’s solid quarter suggests potential for stock growth.
I think long-term investors who have owned AAPL stock forever may simply want to continue holding. While the stock’s valuation is excessive, it’s also true that this is a company that’s worth the premium.
On a capital return basis alone, Apple certainly remains one of the best companies in the world. I don’t think that will change over the next decade.

2024-05-16,3 Warren Buffett Stocks That Look Irresistible Right Now,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B ) portfolio is rich with what the Oracle of Omaha would refer to as “wonderful” businesses. Though Berkshire’s portfolio has skewed away from technology stocks in prior decades, one can’t help but notice that the modern-day Berkshire portfolio has pivoted towards the modern age.
And we’re not just talking about the conglomerate’s massive stake in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Aside from the iPhone maker, which still comprises a huge portion of the overall Berkshire portfolio, even after trimming by 13%, Berkshire owns a sprinkling (less than 1%) in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ).
Apart from Berkshire’s tech-savvy bets, many other holdings within the Berkshire portfolio always stand to gain a lot by investing in technological initiatives. Most notably, American Express (NYSE: AXP ) stands out as a firm that’s equipped to thrive in the data-driven age with its analytics capabilities.
In this piece, we’ll examine three Warren Buffett stocks that look irresistible as they embrace tech to boost long-term growth.
American Express (AXP)

American Express is one of the older holdings within the Berkshire portfolio. Still, unlike other older Berkshire investments that have dragged their feet on the returns front of late, the premier credit card firm has continued to deliver impressive gains. Year-to-date, AXP stock is up more than 28%, thanks in part to some amazing quarters that shot past analyst expectations.
Consumer sentiment could easily get choppier from here as inflation’s impact continues to weigh. That said, American Express looks poised to continue posting solid numbers, as its “spend-centric” model keeps flexing its muscles, even in the face of high inflation and macro headwinds that stand to impact global spending.
Well-of Amex cardholders and spend-happy Millennials, some of whom were brought on just in the past year, do not look to be putting their cards away. As they continue buying a wide range of goods with their Gold and Platinum cards at 2024-era prices, AXP stock certainly stands out as one of the better inflation-fighting stocks in the market. Higher prices on just about everything translate into larger tabs on one’s monthly Amex bill.
Further, given its recent resilience and continued investments in digital transformation, AXP stock still seems a tad undervalued at less than 20 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E).
Visa (V)
Source: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com
Visa (NYSE: V ) is a much smaller holding in the Berkshire portfolio at less than 1% at the time of writing. Indeed, Berkshire and Buffett seem to be fans of the credit card business, and it’s not a mystery as to why. Though V stock hasn’t been nearly as hot, up 7.3%, trailing the market by about 3%, I do view the leading credit card company as worth pursuing after its recent roadbump.
Recently, Piper Sandler started V stock with an overweight rating . The company’s impressive network, which has high barriers to entry around it (a wide economic moat), and tech prowess were major reasons why Piper is a fan of the stock.
Most notably, Piper outlined the potential for generative AI to help “drive upside to fundamentals.” Undoubtedly, Visa is as much a financial technology company as it is a creditcard firm. And you can bet it’s taking generative AI seriously as it seeks to gain any operating or growth edge it can get.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com
Finally, we have the number-one holding in Berkshire’s public stock portfolio. Investors and Buffett followers have plenty of reasons to buy the stock, even if Berkshire is inclined to continue trimming in the near future.
The rest of 2024 could see Apple’s most aggressive push into generative AI yet, with the WWDC24 to begin on June 10, 2024 . Reports suggest the annual multi-day conference could be heavy on generative AI.
Whether it’s as heavy on AI as Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , GOOGL ) Google’s recent I/O 2024 event remains to be seen. Regardless, I’m quite bullish on Apple’s near-term future as it looks to bring the AI tech up a notch for its coming iOS 18. With a ChatGPT deal reportedly close to being inked, AAPL stock may have enough drivers to take it right back to all-time highs of close to $198 per share by year’s end.
At 29.15 times trailing P/E, AAPL stock is getting somewhat frothy again. I view the multiple as worth paying if it means that Siri is going to get a heck of a lot smarter.

2024-05-15,Buffett's Billion-Dollar Biz: 3 Crucial Takeaways From Berkshire's Q1 Results,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
It’s been nearly two weeks since Warren Buffett presided over his company’s annual shareholder meeting in Omaha. The ritual has become a must-attend for those in the industry and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B ) shareholders. There’s no question Berkshire Hathaway stock remains very attractive for long-term investors.
The media’s gone over many of the highlights, so I won’t delve into the events of that weekend in Nebraska. It sounded, as always, like a lot of fun. The biggest downer: Charlie Munger wasn’t there to throw out the usual zingers he’s become known for. Munger will be remembered for years to come.
I’ve always felt that Berkshire is the ultimate mutual fund. This is because it charges no fees, provides healthy long-term returns, and protects against the downside. You will find that this is unlike few stocks in the United States.
If you could only own one stock, besides the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA: SPY ), which Buffett recommends most investors buy, it would be Berkshire Hathaway.
Drawing from the company’s Q1 2024 results, here are three reasons.
It’s a Team Game with Berkshire Hathaway Stock
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
The one thing I love about Berkshire is that it’s like a sports team in that there’s always somebody performing well to drag the rest of the team along, even when they don’t want to. They all sink or swim together.
In the latest quarter, its operating earnings were $11.2 billion , 4o% higher than a year earlier. That’s the figure to look at when studying the company’s quarterly and annual reports.
If you use net earnings, you’ll get wild swings in the results due to investment gains and losses (realized and unrealized) that must be reported each quarter. In Q1 2024, its net earnings were $12.70 billion, 64% lower than a year ago.
There are seven items that make up operating earnings. In the first quarter, BNSF, the company’s railroad business, had operating earnings that were 8.3% lower than a year earlier. The only other item with a decrease was its investments in companies where it doesn’t control a majority, owning between 20% and 50%. Those earnings were almost 29% lower year-over-year.
The good news is these two businesses only accounted for less than 14% of its operating earnings.
There will come a day when both of these businesses outperform their five other stablemates, likely when they are most needed to keep overall earnings growing.
Buffett Sold Apple for a Couple of Reasons
Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com
Berkshire’s Q1 2024 results showed that the company cut its stake in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) by about 13% in the first quarter to 790 million shares. While that’s a significant reduction, it still leaves the company with shares accounting for 40.2% of its $367 million equity portfolio. That’s four times its next largest holding — Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) at 10.9%.
The first reason sold some of its Apple stock was to get more cash. With interest rates still high and stocks overvalued — Apple trades at 28x earnings compared to a multiple between 12 and 20 times earnings when Berkshire acquired most of its AAPL stock — the interest it earns on its $189 billion cash pile is a real incentive to lock-in some gains on its Apple stock.
Who knows? He might buy some more if it drops in the future. However, Berkshire shareholders ought to be happy that he’s lowered the overweight weight Apple has on the entire company’s assets.
Diversification when you’ve got a great team is not a bad thing.
Buffett’s Getting a Faster Trigger Finger
How many years did it take the company to jump off the Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ) bandwagon after it became patently clear that the bank had a broken business model that it is just now getting over the scandals that plagued the company.
In February, the Office of the Controller of the Currency ( OCC ) terminated its consent order , first implemented in September 2016, that forced the company to clean up its act over its sales practices.
“Confirmation from the OCC that we have effectively implemented what was required is a result of the hard work of so many of our employees, and I’d like to thank everyone at Wells Fargo involved for their dedication to transforming how we do business,” stated CEO Peter Scharf in a prepared statement.
Berkshire sold off the last of WFC shares in Q1 2022 , six years after the OCC’s consent orcder went into effect. That’s a long time to stand by a company.
In the case of Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA ), he had no such patience. He said at the annual meeting that he alone decided to sell its entire stake in the troubled firm, crystallizing a significant capital loss for the company.
On the one hand, it’s never good to take a loss. On the other hand, it has significant unrealized gains on its equity portfolio — $232.1 billion at the end of March — to offset these gains.
We don’t know if Buffett was behind the buy but he had no problem taking responsibility for the sale. That’s what you want in an investment manager. The ability to move on when you’ve made a mistake.

Even amidst macroeconomic headwinds, the S&P 500 index has remained resilient. For the year-to-date, the index has trended higher by 10%. While it’s good to remain optimistic, preparing for the worst is equally important. I don’t intend to be a fearmonger and it’s unlikely that there will be a big crash. However, even a 10% to 15% correction in the index is significant. To remain prepared for any such scenario, this column intends to discuss some low-risk, high-reward stocks to buy and hold.
It’s first important to understand the reason for remaining cautious. GDP growth decelerated in Q1 2024, and this calls for rate cuts. However, with stubborn inflation, the Fed will likely be slow in pursuing expansionary policies. Fear of a hard landing will likely be the catalyst for a market correction.
The first-rate cut is likely before the Presidential elections. Therefore, any weakness in the market would be an opportunity to accumulate quality stocks. For now, let’s discuss three low-risk, high-reward stocks to buy.
Panasonic Holdings (PCRFY)

In my view, Panasonic Holdings (OTCMKTS: PCRFY ) stock is a low-risk bet for two reasons. First, PCRFY stock has already been oversold and has mainly remained sideways in the last 12 months. Considering a forward price-earnings ratio of 8.5, I don’t see a downside from current levels for this 1.26% dividend yield stock.
Further, Panasonic Holdings is among the major players in the EV battery market. The company is high on innovation and has ambitious expansion plans through 2031. Once industry sentiments change, PCRFY stock is likely to deliver multibagger returns.
In terms of expansion plans, Panasonic is targeting to boost its EV battery manufacturing capacity to 200GWh by 2031. This will translate into steady revenue growth coupled with EBITDA margin expansion.
On the innovation front, Panasonic has partnered with Sila Nanotechnologies to “purchase next-generation nano-composite silicon anode material for EV lithium-ion batteries.” By 2031, Panasonic aims to achieve a 25% increase in battery energy density. With all these positives, it’s a good time to buy PCRFY stock.
Apple (AAPL)

The last few quarters have been mixed for technology stocks . Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) stock has surged 215% in the previous 12 months. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock has remained sideways during the same period. In my view, investors can consider some allocation to innovation driven ideas that have remained subdued. Apple is possibly among the best names to consider.
An important point to note is that the application of AI is being talked about across sectors. AI is expected to contribute $15 trillion to the global economy by 2030. I believe the markets are waiting for Apple’s big AI push. Once that’s clear, AAPL stock is likely to surge higher.
Apple ended Q2 2024 with $161 billion in cash and equivalents . This provides ample flexibility to invest in next-generation technology for its devices. Apple has already been making small acquisitions in the AI space. In another recent news, Apple is planning to sell its Vision Pro mixed-reality headset outside the United States. The wearable and services segment has ample scope for growth in the coming years.
Vale (VALE)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
Among blue-chip commodity stocks, Vale (NYSE: VALE ) is worth buying at current levels of $12.5. VALE stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 5.2, indicatinghe extent of undervaluation. The stock also offers an attractive dividend yield of 8.8%.
Regarding potential returns, analysts have a median price target of $16 for the stock. This would imply an upside of 28% from current levels. Therefore, the total return from VALE stock is likely at 35% to 40% in the next 12 months, with valuations indicating limited downside risk.
Vale will benefit from relatively higher iron ore prices from a business perspective. A possible rate cut towards the end of the year can trigger a rally for industrial commodities. This will support revenue and adjust EBITDA upside.
It’s worth noting that for Q1 2024, Vale reported the highest quarterly iron ore production since 2019. Copper and nickel production also witnessed healthy growth. If this trend is sustained, the company will be positioned to deliver strong free cash flows.

2024-05-15,2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever,"Choosing stocks that you never have to sell has enormous advantages. If you choose well, it means you can let the investment compound in value for potentially decades. As Warren Buffett knows all too well, uninterrupted compound interest is the best way to build lasting wealth.
Since 1965, Buffett's investing skills have steered Berkshire Hathaway 's shares to an awe-inspiring return of 4,384,748% through 2023. A key component of those returns was selected investments in stocks of strong companies in its $300-plus-billion equity portfolio. Let's look at two of its top stock holdings that can grow for decades.
Warren Buffett has a long history of betting big on strong consumer brands. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has a loyal customer base that is willing to give up many other things before their iPhones. The stock has returned 531% since Berkshire first started buying the stock in 2016, which brought its stake to a value of $174 billion at the end of 2023.",7

2024-05-15,Berkshire Hathaway Stock Alert: Warren Buffett Could Reveal His Mystery Buy Today,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Conglomerate giant Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A , NYSE: BRK-B ) – which covers a broad range of sectors from insurance to utilities – saw its shares grab the spotlight on Wednesday. Speculation has heightened around a confidential position that Warren Buffett’s enterprise acquired at some point in the second half of 2023. With the disclosure deadline today, the Warren Buffett mystery stock could be revealed soon.
According to Investor’s Business Daily , the conglomerate previously stated during its Q1 earnings report that it reduced a significant position in consumer technology giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) by 13%. It also exited multinational mass media firm Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA ). However, not all of the moves were revealed publicly, which could come in a 13F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) late Wednesday.
The spotlight centers on the so-called Berkshire Hathaway mystery stock. Several Buffett watchers speculate that the security may relate to a financial firm. Per Edward Jones analyst James Shanahan, it could be Charles Schwab (NYSE: SCHW ), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) or American International Group (NYSE: AIG ).
Business publication Barron’s added its own possible candidates for the Berkshire Hathaway mystery stock. Besides Morgan Stanley, it identified BlackRock (NYSE: BLK ) or Chubb (NYSE: CB ). “The mystery company or companies probably are in the financial sector because the cost basis of Berkshire’s equity holdings in financial stocks has risen by about $5 billion in the past three quarters and declined for two other categories of stocks,” wrote Barron’s Andrew Bary.
Not the First Rodeo Regarding a Berkshire Hathaway Mystery Stock
Institutional stakeholders of U.S.-based securities reveal their positions in 13F disclosures. However, according to the SEC website, these investors have the option of requesting confidential treatment . That’s exactly what Berkshire did regarding its Q4 filing.
While interest has spiked regarding the Berkshire Hathaway mystery stock, this isn’t the first time the conglomerate has requested such treatment. In late 2020, Berkshire requested confidentiality when it was acquiring shares of Chevron (NYSE: CVX ) and Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ).
However, to Barron’s point, the “company makes use of confidential filings more than other big investors.” It then raises the question about the significance of the Berkshire Hathaway mystery stock in relation to the conglomerate’s strategy.
According to a research paper submitted to the Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis , entities may choose to keep their trades quiet because “confidential positions earn positive and significant abnormal returns over the post-filing confidential period.”
In other words, confidential investments tend to perform better relative to normal market expectations. Therefore, keeping the cards close to the chest may better protect proprietary investing strategies.
Why It Matters
It’s not out of the realm of possibility that Berkshire could request another quarter of confidential treatment. However, Barron’s states that such a circumstance would be unusual. Should the disclosure come later today, the conglomerate will likely amend its filings for Q3 and Q4 to include the much-discussed security.

2024-05-15,"Apple announces new accessibility features, including Eye Tracking, Music Haptics, and Vocal Shortcuts","Apple® today announced new accessibility features coming later this year, including Eye Tracking, a way for users with physical disabilities to control iPad® or iPhone® with their eyes. Additionally, Music Haptics will offer a new way for users who are deaf or hard of hearing to experience music using the Taptic Engine® in iPhone; Vocal Shortcuts will allow users to perform tasks by making a custom sound; Vehicle Motion Cues can help reduce motion sickness when using iPhone or iPad in a moving vehicle; and more accessibility features will come to visionOS™. These features combine the power of Apple hardware and software, harnessing Apple silicon, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to further Apple’s decades-long commitment to designing products for everyone.
“We believe deeply in the transformative power of innovation to enrich lives,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “That’s why for nearly 40 years, Apple has championed inclusive design by embedding accessibility at the core of our hardware and software. We’re continuously pushing the boundaries of technology, and these new features reflect our long-standing commitment to delivering the best possible experience to all of our users.”
“Each year, we break new ground when it comes to accessibility,” said Sarah Herrlinger, Apple’s senior director of Global Accessibility Policy and Initiatives. “These new features will make an impact in the lives of a wide range of users, providing new ways to communicate, control their devices, and move through the world.”
Eye Tracking Comes to iPad and iPhone
Powered by artificial intelligence, Eye Tracking gives users a built-in option for navigating iPad and iPhone with just their eyes. Designed for users with physical disabilities, Eye Tracking uses the front-facing camera to set up and calibrate in seconds, and with on-device machine learning, all data used to set up and control this feature is kept securely on device, and isn’t shared with Apple.
Eye Tracking works across iPadOS® and iOS apps, and doesn’t require additional hardware or accessories. With Eye Tracking, users can navigate through the elements of an app and use Dwell Control to activate each element, accessing additional functions such as physical buttons, swipes, and other gestures solely with their eyes.
Music Haptics Makes Songs More Accessible
Music Haptics is a new way for users who are deaf or hard of hearing to experience music on iPhone. With this accessibility feature turned on, the Taptic Engine in iPhone plays taps, textures, and refined vibrations to the audio of the music. Music Haptics works across millions of songs in the Apple Music® catalog, and will be available as an API for developers to make music more accessible in their apps.
New Features for a Wide Range of Speech
With Vocal Shortcuts, iPhone and iPad users can assign custom utterances that Siri® can understand to launch shortcuts and complete complex tasks. Listen for Atypical Speech, another new feature, gives users an option for enhancing speech recognition for a wider range of speech. Listen for Atypical Speech uses on-device machine learning to recognize user speech patterns. Designed for users with acquired or progressive conditions that affect speech, such as cerebral palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or stroke, these features provide a new level of customization and control, building on features introduced in iOS 17 for users who are nonspeaking or at risk of losing their ability to speak.
“Artificial intelligence has the potential to improve speech recognition for millions of people with atypical speech, so we are thrilled that Apple is bringing these new accessibility features to consumers,” said Mark Hasegawa-Johnson, the Speech Accessibility Project at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign’s principal investigator. “The Speech Accessibility Project was designed as a broad-based, community-supported effort to help companies and universities make speech recognition more robust and effective, and Apple is among the accessibility advocates who made the Speech Accessibility Project possible.”
Vehicle Motion Cues Can Help Reduce Motion Sickness
Vehicle Motion Cues is a new experience for iPhone and iPad that can help reduce motion sickness for passengers in moving vehicles. Research shows that motion sickness is commonly caused by a sensory conflict between what a person sees and what they feel, which can prevent some users from comfortably using iPhone or iPad while riding in a moving vehicle. With Vehicle Motion Cues, animated dots on the edges of the screen represent changes in vehicle motion to help reduce sensory conflict without interfering with the main content. Using sensors built into iPhone and iPad, Vehicle Motion Cues recognizes when a user is in a moving vehicle and responds accordingly. The feature can be set to show automatically on iPhone, or can be turned on and off in Control Center.
CarPlay Gets Voice Control, More Accessibility Updates
Accessibility features coming to CarPlay® include Voice Control, Color Filters, and Sound Recognition. With Voice Control, users can navigate CarPlay and control apps with just their voice. With Sound Recognition, drivers or passengers who are deaf or hard of hearing can turn on alerts to be notified of car horns and sirens. For users who are colorblind, Color Filters make the CarPlay interface visually easier to use, with additional visual accessibility features including Bold Text and Large Text.
Accessibility Features Coming to visionOS
This year, accessibility features coming to visionOS will include systemwide Live Captions to help everyone — including users who are deaf or hard of hearing — follow along with spoken dialogue in live conversations and in audio from apps. With Live Captions for FaceTime® in visionOS, more users can easily enjoy the unique experience of connecting and collaborating using their Persona. Apple Vision Pro™ will add the capability to move captions using the window bar during Apple Immersive Video, as well as support for additional Made for iPhone hearing devices and cochlear hearing processors. Updates for vision accessibility will include the addition of Reduce Transparency, Smart Invert, and Dim Flashing Lights for users who have low vision, or those who want to avoid bright lights and frequent flashing.
These features join the dozens of accessibility features already available in Apple Vision Pro, which offers a flexible input system and an intuitive interface designed with a wide range of users in mind. Features such as VoiceOver, Zoom, and Color Filters can also provide users who are blind or have low vision access to spatial computing, while features such as Guided Access can support users with cognitive disabilities. Users can control Vision Pro with any combination of their eyes, hands, or voice, with accessibility features including Switch Control, Sound Actions, and Dwell Control that can also help those with physical disabilities.
“Apple Vision Pro is without a doubt the most accessible technology I’ve ever used,” said Ryan Hudson-Peralta, a Detroit-based product designer, accessibility consultant, and cofounder of Equal Accessibility LLC. “As someone born without hands and unable to walk, I know the world was not designed with me in mind, so it’s been incredible to see that visionOS just works. It’s a testament to the power and importance of accessible and inclusive design.”
Additional Updates
For users who are blind or have low vision, VoiceOver will include new voices, a flexible Voice Rotor, custom volume control, and the ability to customize VoiceOver keyboard shortcuts on Mac®.
Magnifier will offer a new Reader Mode and the option to easily launch Detection Mode with the Action button.
Braille users will get a new way to start and stay in Braille Screen Input for faster control and text editing; Japanese language availability for Braille Screen Input; support for multi-line braille with Dot Pad ; and the option to choose different input and output tables.

For users at risk of losing their ability to speak, Personal Voice will be available in Mandarin Chinese. Users who have difficulty pronouncing or reading full sentences will be able to create a Personal Voice using shortened phrases.
For users who are nonspeaking, Live Speech will include categories and simultaneous compatibility with Live Captions .
For users with physical disabilities, Virtual Trackpad for AssistiveTouch® allows users to control their device using a small region of the screen as a resizable trackpad.
Switch Control will include the option to use the cameras in iPhone and iPad to recognize finger-tap gestures as switches.
Voice Control will offer support for custom vocabularies and complex words.

2024-05-14,"3 Cryptos to Turn $100,000 Into $1 Million: Spring 2024","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
I am more confident investing in cryptos as an asset class for the long term. The reason is that the world of cryptocurrency has navigated the fear of being banned. Instead, the centralized and decentralized world seems to be working together, and the launch of the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETF underscores my view. Having said that, I would prefer to stick to top names if I had to select cryptos to buy for the long term.
The focus of this column is on three cryptos to buy and hold for five years (2028) for 10-bagger returns. Knowing the world of cryptos, 10x returns can come earlier. However, it’s good to be prudent in terms of expectations.
I would also like to add that I will not allocate more than 15% of my overall investment portfolio towards cryptos. However, even a 15% allocation will have a big impact, since we are talking about 10-bagger returns.
Let’s discuss three cryptos to buy and hold through 2028 for multibagger returns potential.
Bitcoin (BTC)
Source: Sittipong Phokawattana / Shutterstock.com
Bitcoin is the blue chip among cryptocurrencies. It’s like holding Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) or Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) in the crypto world. With crypto halving done, Bitcoin has trended higher by 42% for year-to-date and trades at $63,000. There are ample catalysts that will ensure that the uptrend sustains for Bitcoin.
In March, Cathie Wood opined that Bitcoin can trade as high as $3.8 million by 2030. That would imply an upside of nearly 6,000% from current levels. I must add here that Jack Dorsey recently opined that Bitcoin is likely to trade above $1 million by 2030.
Cathie’s estimates might be too optimistic, but if we look at a base-case scenario, 20x returns are likely by the end of the decade. There are two reasons for this view.
First, Bitcoin has a limited supply. As crypto adoption increases, the demand-supply scenario will be tight. That will translate into an uptrend. Further, long-term monetary policies will likely be expansionary. That is positive for risky asset classes like cryptocurrencies.
Ethereum (ETH)
Source: Thaninee Chuensomchit / Shutterstock.com
It’s worth noting that Bitcoin has trended higher by 40% year-to-date. During the same period, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) has rallied by 25%. The cryptocurrency continues to lag Bitcoin in terms of returns. However, I would not be surprised if Ethereum catches up in the coming years.
When the Bitcoin spot ETF was announced, the cryptocurrency surged higher. I expect a similar scenario for Ethereum with an ETF likely in the coming quarters. Analysts are talking about Ethereum trading at $15,000 by 2025. In my view, $10,000 levels are likely next year if the ETF is approved and the crypto bull market sustains.
I would also go back to Vitalik Buterin’s view in 2022 that Ethereum development is 55% complete after the merge. In the next few years, the cryptocurrency will likely surge as the roadmap progresses. Some key impending developments include increasing transaction speed and lowering cost.
BNB (BNB)
Source: Shutterstock
Binance is among the top 10 centralized crypto exchanges in the world. The BNB ( BNB-USD ) coin can be used to pay fees while trading on the Binance exchange. Further, users holding BNB coins above a certain threshold are given VIP tiers and additional fee discounts. Therefore, the first point to note is that the coin has a strong use case.
Another important point is that the bull market for cryptocurrencies is far from euphoric. It’s likely the best part of the current bull market will unfold in the next 12 to 18 months. That will translate into dozens of altcoins delivering multibagger returns.
The reason to mention this is to underscore the point that trading volumes will surge in the coming quarters. That will benefit some of the largest centralized exchanges like Binance. With a strong use case, the BNB coin is likely to trend higher.

Some investors favor blue-chip stocks that often provide the safest, most stable investments. Companies deemed blue-chip stocks have a long history of consistently excellent performance, profits and great dividends.
If you want to find the best blue-chip stocks to buy and make excellent, sure profits in the long term, look no further. These three stocks are giants within their respective industries. They’ve shown resilience to economic fluctuation and boast some of the most profitable and stable growth histories within stocks.
We’ll detail the services and products that make these stocks so profitable and the reasons their business models allow them to withstand the test of time.
Blackstone (BX)
Source: Isabelle OHara / Shutterstock.com
Blackstone (NYSE: BX ) is the most significant player in the competitive alternative asset management industry. It manages over $1 trillion in assets , including 12,500 real estate assets and private equity, in a diverse list of over 230 companies.
BX charges a fee to the owners of the assets it manages. And that fee increases along with the total assets that Blackstone manages. Growth and acquisitions mean more money for Blackstone. It has made exponential strides over the last 10 years but faced some economic headwinds due to rising interest rates.
Also, the company has increased its assets by billions in the last few years alone. In the first quarter of this year, Blackstone reported net accrued performance revenues of $6.1 billion , of which $1.2 billion will be distributed to shareholders. Real estate was the only section of Blackstone’s asset performance that took a hit, while the rest continued to improve.
Therefore, investors can feel confident about buying Blackstone at the reasonable valuation it holds right now. The stock is consistent and shows little to no sign of risk to impede the long-term profits that you can receive holding this stock.
Apple (AAPL)

As one of the most profitable companies, little needs to be said for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Mainstream consumers of almost all ages and backgrounds use Apple’s products and services, and the company continues to innovate and push the boundaries of technology.
While Apple has seen more volatility than other blue-chip stocks, it has powered through and consistently set new heights. AAPL has some of the most popular electronics, such as iPhones, iPads and watches. iPhones alone reached revenue of $231.3 billion in 2023.
In addition to its explosively popular electronics, Apple has seen wild success from its services so far this year. Streaming services like Apple TV and Apple Music have been consistently growing in popularity. In fact, they set a new record in revenue in Q2 of this year, reaching $90.8 billion.
Apple reported an EPS beat with a .66% increase in EPS, reaching quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.53. The company’s global popularity and projected continued growth make it an excellent blue chip stock to buy and hold for the long term.
Marsh & McLennan Companies (MMC)

Marsh & McLennan Companies (NYSE: MMC ) is an international advisory company for companies worldwide. The company specializes in insurance and acts as an advisor and broker to help clients obtain the necessary policies. The most significant benefit of Marsh & McLennan is its inherent ability to thrive in economic pitfalls.
Businesses always seek ways to protect their assets and avoid harmful liabilities in regular and unpredictable environments. Insurance will always be necessary, meaning Marsh & McLennan will have a consistent roster of clients for the foreseeable future. In addition to steady income, insurance provides the additional benefit of increased profitability during times of high inflation.
It’s no surprise that Marsh & McLennan prospered during last year’s inflation hike. The company reported $14 billion in revenue in 2023 and will likely continue its double-digit growth this year.
Marsh & McLennan is a model blue-chip stock with solid, consistent growth and profits that will surely create excellent long-term returns for investors.

2024-05-14,3 Retail Stocks Most at Risk of the New Cautious Consumer Trend,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
With consumer spending trends tightening and the average U.S. wage stagnating, investors should watch out for retail stocks at risk of a plunge. According to Deloitte Insights , 73% of consumers are still relatively concerned about the rising costs of goods and services. There is a general uneasiness around inflation, the cost of rent and the expensive nature of groceries and necessities.
Ultimately, this has driven consumers to reconsider what they spend their money on, which will undoubtedly impact the retail companies that sell non-essential items to the average person. Furthermore, this trend could also impact retailers who rely on a premium shopping experience to attract customers. In these cases, the retailer may upcharge on necessities to improve aesthetics and overall offerings. Thus, investors should keep an eye on the companies that no longer provide competitive value to average consumers.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com
Recent buybacks helped Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock out of its most recent slump, but consumer reactions to its new iPad commercial could give clues about broader attitudes towards the company’s products. The ad shows a collection of instruments, machines, cameras and other things that creatives hold dear being crushed by a massive hydraulic press. Though the ad is undoubtedly creative, it’s genuinely uncomfortable to watch and received an unending wave of negative reactions on social media.
So what does this mean for Apple? Well, consumer backlash against an ad won’t do much. But it does show that people care less about the product and more about the message from a company. The message Apple used to deliver was one of unending innovation, with each product generation being so much better than the last that you just had to upgrade or miss out.
Today, there’s little difference between Apple devices from year to year, which resulted in an 11% drop in Mac sales and a 15% drop in iPad sales last year. Time will tell if Apple will regain its sales momentum.
Best Buy (BBY)
Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com
Once renowned for its extensive selection of electronics and great customer service, Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ) has struggled with many of its underperforming store locations. In fiscal year 2024, which ended Jan. 31, 2024, the company closed 24 of its locations while still managing to keep revenue growing thanks to the holiday shopping season. Now in its fiscal year 2025, the company expects to close another 10-15 locations. The reason? A lack of a compelling shopping experience.
Why would consumers, who are already hunting for the best deals, choose to shop at Best Buy? After all, with how competitive the online retail market has become, a traditional warehouse model like the kind Best Buy offers simply isn’t convenient. There are still some advantages to being able to go and see a device in person before buying it, but even Best Buy knows it needs to adapt.
Now the company is pivoting towards a more modern and streamlined shopping experience while planning to discontinue many of its less profitable offerings. Yet, Best Buy could still be one of the retail stocks at risk until it finds its edge again.
Target (TGT)
Source: jejim / Shutterstock.com
Often considered the more premium alternative to larger supermarkets, Target’s (NYSE: TGT ) one-stop-shop model used to be incredibly competitive. Many shoppers swore by the company’s in-house brands while still having a vast array of brand-name products to choose from on its shelves. Furthermore, Target stores were known for being cleaner, safer and overall more attractive to shoppers of a higher socioeconomic standing.
However, due to rising retail theft in major U.S. urban centers such as New York, San Franciso, Seattle and Portland, the company had to shutter nine of its locations last year in October. This concerning trend is a result of the district attorneys within those cities choosing not to prosecute theft, emboldening criminals to steal and resell Target’s merchandise online.
Even worse for Target, consumers may choose to shop at its rivals like Walmart (NYSE: WMT ) instead for more competitive prices in a time where the shopping experience matters less than saving money. This may ultimately place TGT among retail stocks at risk of a loss.

2024-05-14,Apple Addiction: 3 Fund Managers Doubling Down on AAPL Stock,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Despite the weakness in Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone sales in China, there are still funds buying Apple stock.
Almost a year ago, I wrote about fund managers still buying Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) stock despite being up 25% on its Q1 2024 results. Its shares have more than doubled over the past 52 weeks.
Can Apple do the same?
I’m not sure that is in the cards, but there is evidence that its share price is undervalued at the moment, prompting fund managers to buy AAPL stock, which is down more than 1% year-to-date.
Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani believes Apple is a Buy. The analyst rates it Outperform with a $220 target price, 20% higher than where it’s currently trading.
“Investors should not underestimate the ability of the iPhone to continue to deliver growth over the next five years,” Barron’s reported the analyst’s comments from a May 9 note to clients.
Here are three fund managers who feel the same.
Norges Bank
Source: shutterstock.com/NeoLeo
Norges Bank is Norway’s central bank , fulfilling a role similar to that of the U.S. Federal Reserve. However, it is different because it also manages the country’s Government Pension Fund Global on behalf of Norway’s Ministry of Finance. The fund’s current market value is 17.71 trillion Swedish kroner ($1.63 trillion).
WhaleWisdom.com data suggests that the fund made a new position in the fourth quarter of 2023, adding 176.1 million shares of Apple stock valued at $33.91 billion as of Dec. 31, 2023.
However, that isn’t entirely accurate.
Looking back on the central bank’s 13F-HR forms, it has owned Apple for years. At the end of 2022, it owned 167.37 million shares . Then, for the next few quarters, its 13F-HR forms were confidential to meet disclosure requirements under Norwegian law.
As discussed above, the latest 13F showed that it held 176.1 million shares of Apple stock, so I’m going to assume that it added approximately 8.73 million Apple shares in 2023, a 5.2% increase from 2022.
While Norges Bank isn’t one of Apple’s top owners, it is one of the 10 largest, in ninth position as of Dec. 31. Apple is the fund’s second-largest holding behind Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), whose shares were valued at $35.92 billion at the end of 2023.
Cerity Partners
Source: Shutterstock
One of the investment firms to add the most Apple shares in the final quarter of 2023 was a much smaller asset manager. Cerity Partners initiated a new position of 9.43 million shares of Apple, accounting for 3.59% of its $30.44 billion in assets listed on its 13F.
Like Norges Bank, Apple is the asset manager’s second-largest holding, behind only the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA: VOO ). With a 4.01% weighting and a market value of $1.22 billion, Apple’s valuation at the end of December was about $108 million higher than its Apple shareholdings valuation.
In the case of Cerity, the position is new because it converted debt securities valued at approximately $702 million at the end of Q3 2023 in the fourth quarter of 2023.
The New York City hedge fund and financial advisor has 16,424 clients and nearly $65 billion in assets under management.
Interestingly, at the end of 2022, it held 4.82 million shares of Apple stock, so clearly, Cerity’s opinion of Apple stock has gotten even stronger over the past 16 months.
SpiderRock Advisors
Source: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.com
SpiderRock Advisors is the smallest of three investment managers with a Q4 2023 13F of $4.02 billion and assets under management of $4.85 billion from 335 clients. Based in Chicago, Apple is its largest holding, accounting for 13.52% of its $4 billion in 13F assets.
After reviewing the nuances of the Cerity Partners example from above, I checked SpiderRock’s 13Fs to confirm that it is a new position.
At the end of Q3 2024, it held put options for 629,900 shares . It did not own any Apple shares outright. At the end of Q4 2023, it had 3.13 million shares and put options for another 652,600 shares, an increase of 22,700 from the previous quarter.
However, it’s not an entirely new position in that it’s never held an interest in Apple stock. At the end of Q4 2022 , it had call options for 600 shares and put options for 453,900. A year before that, it held put options for 127,800 shares as of Dec. 31, 2021.
The above situation illustrates why it’s essential to look at the actual 13Fs and not just data from third-party providers such as WhaleWisdom.com. WhaleWisdom.com is an excellent resource, but if you don’t subscribe to its paid service, you’ll not get the full picture.

The Metaverse was once thought to be the next iteration of the internet. However, after billions of dollars of investments from tech companies, the Metaverse has yet to live to its full potential. Still, the largest tech companies in the world continue to invest in the Metaverse in hardware and software. It’s surprising how advanced the technology has become in just a few short years. As investors, the best investments are made in the early, undercover ideas that others may not fully understand. Here are three Metaverse stocks to buy for those interested in the opportunity and possibility of the Metaverse.
Meta Platforms (META)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) is a no-brainer as one of the top Metaverse stocks to buy after changing its name from Facebook to Meta in 2021. As of May 2024, Meta is the seventh-largest company in the world by market cap and one of only seven companies worth more than $1 trillion. How does Wall Street feel about Meta? In April, 53 of 62 analyst recommendations were a Buy or Strong Buy rating. Additionally, its average price target of $516.13 is nearly $40 higher than its current price of $476.20.
Since 2020, the Reality Labs department at Meta has lost over $45 billion. While CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that spending will decline on the Metaverse, Reality Labs will continue to operate. Products like the Oculus AR/VR goggles and brand new Rayban Meta Smart Glasses have demonstrated their commitment to the Metaverse. Meta also sees an opportunity to expand to enterprise solutions and collaboration tools.
After gaining 37.5% in 2024, Meta’s stock remains cheap on a price multiple basis. Shares trade at just 8.8x sales and 24.1x forward earnings while maintaining an impressive 32% revenue CAGR over the past ten years. Even beyond its Metaverse potential, Meta is a company that is firing on all cylinders and shareholders can count on being richly rewarded.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is a name that needs no introduction. It is the second-largest company in the world, next to Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). Of the 38 analyst recommendations received in May, the stock has 32 Buy or Strong Buy ratings. The average analyst price target of $202.36 also represents a strong 10% upside from the current price.
With the launch of its VisionPro Headset earlier this year, Apple jumped headfirst into AR/VR. VisionPro only adds to Apple’s strong hardware base, with more than 2.2 billion active devices worldwide as of February 2024. With the headset on, users can operate most applications from the Apple ecosystem in real-time virtual reality. From messaging to streaming videos to Facetiming friends worldwide, VisionPro gives a small taste of Apple’s long-term plans in the Metaverse.
Apple stock is trading at a relatively reasonable 7.4x sales and 27.9x forward earnings. After dipping its toe into the Metaverse and recently committing to building data center chips for AI, investors should look to Apple as a company that may be on the cusp of its next big growth story.
Autodesk (ADSK)
Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com
Autodesk (NASDAQ: ADSK ) is a tech company that builds software platforms for architecture and design. Analysts remain bullish on the stock despite ADSK returning a loss of about 7.0% this year. As a testament to this, the average analyst price target of $287 represents about 30% upside from its current price and the street-high price target of $320 is nearly 50% higher.
This company utilizes the Metaverse as a way for users to design and model buildings in virtual reality. Using the Metaverse, Autodesk allows for greater remote collaboration and a more precise simulation. In this way, Autodesk is one company that uses Metaverse to improve efficiencies and productivity for the users of its software platforms.
Due to its underperformance this year, Autodesk is trading at more attractive and depressed multiples. With shares trading at just 8.5x sales , its P/S ratio is nearly the lowest it has ever been in the past five years. While Autodesk doesn’t get the coverage that Meta and Apple get, you can bet on it as a well-run software company that will only continue maintaining its 16% five-year revenue CAGR.

2024-05-14,Stick a Fork in It and Run! Intel Stock Is Done.,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) was a darling of the chipmaking market many years ago. Then, it was a laughingstock in 2022, and then a darling again in 2023. Now, Intel is a troubled business again in 2024. Honestly, who really needs to invest in a nauseating roller-coaster play like Intel stock?
We’re giving the stock a “D” grade and telling you right now that it’s perfectly fine to get off that roller coaster. Just look at the progress of the Intel share price from May 2023 to May 2024.
That’s right — there was no progress during that time frame. Intel stock was “dead money,” and we didn’t identify any compelling reasons to invest your hard-earned capital in Intel now.
U.S. Blocks Intel’s Chip Sales to Huawei
As multiple reporters have stated, the U.S. government has banned Intel from exporting to China-based technology-product manufacturer Huawei Technologies . The objective is for the U.S. to curb China’s tech-industry power.
That’s bad news for Intel, a major supplier of chips to Huawei. Intel has acknowledged that Huawei export ban would put pressure on the chipmaker’s revenue.
This is the worst possible timing for Intel. The company is trying to reinvent itself as a foundry chipmaker. By that, we mean Intel seeks to manufacture its own chips and sell them to other companies.
Considering this adverse development, Daniel Newman, CEO of The Futurum Group, offered a stark warning about Intel stock.
“There’s no reason to own it in the short-term, since short-term investors have to deal with capex outlays, issues with the foundry business, and a lack of meaningful data-center growth,” Newman cautioned.
Apple Will Be a Tough Competitor to Intel
In case there wasn’t enough negative news about Intel, here’s another distressing tidbit. As you may be aware, artificial intelligence personal computer chips are an important revenue source for Intel. Now, Intel will have a major competitor in this area.
Actually, “competitor” might not be the right word; “obliterator” may be more appropriate. Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) new M4 chip is supposedly so powerful that it could make the competitors’ AI-PC chips instantly obsolete.
Per Yahoo! Finance , Apple claims that the M4 chip’s neural engine is the “company’s fastest yet.” The M4 is apparently “more powerful than any neural processing unit available on today’s AI PCs.”
Consider the implications for Intel in 2024. Apple is a massive, capital-rich juggernaut that can continue to develop its chips. Intel now has to fend off the threat posed by Apple’s ultrapowerful M4 chip. To borrow some old song lyrics, we “see a bad moon rising” for Intel.
Intel Stock: Say ‘No, Thanks’ to the Roller Coaster
Intel’s shareholders were either brilliant or just luck in 2023. Hopefully, they had the foresight to take profits while those profits were available.
Today, we’ve just given you some compelling reasons to either be neutral or bearish on Intel in 2024. All in all, we’ll continue to monitor the company for further developments, but we’re assigning Intel stock a “D” grade and aren’t currently recommending it.

2024-05-14,Alphabet Stock Outlook: Pounce on GOOG if There's an Open AI-Driven Sell-Off,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ,NASDAQ: GOOGL ) has been flying high, but this latest Alphabet stock rally is losing momentum amid fears of a sell-off. Investors worry the company’s advertising moat is diminishing.
The fear, uncertainty, and doubt may scare off skittish investors, but a sell-off could benefit those with a long-term perspective.
Alphabet Stock and the Recent OpenAI News
Over the past year, Alphabet has made significant progress in demonstrating to the market that it is not an “also ran” when it comes to generative AI technology. This AI progress played a role in the company’s strong fiscal performance during the preceding quarter .
However, while increased confidence in Alphabet’s AI catalyst played a role in Alphabet stock continuing to rally after its April 25 quarterly earnings release, as mentioned above, this rally could be fast giving way to a pullback. It all has to do with two recent news items regarding AI technology rising star OpenAI .
First, news that Alphabet lost out to OpenAI for a potentially game-changing mobile AI integration deal with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Second, rumors regarding OpenAI’s plans to unveil a new AI-powered search engine .
OpenAI partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), which integrated AI into its Bing search engine. Now OpenAI plans to supplant Google in search.
Rumors have had a moderate impact on GOOG’s price and could continue to affect shares. Or worse, all of a sudden have a significant impact.
An Overreaction Could Prove Advantageous
Yes, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has denied that an unveiling or launch of a search product from the company is imminent. Yet while this may be technically true, there are enough anecdotes out there to suggest that a major update on this could arrive soon .
Now, I’m not saying that if OpenAI unveils an AI search product in the months ahead, this will cause Alphabet stock to sink toward its 52-week low. It may, however, drive a moderate pullback. For instance, a move back down to between $125 and $150 per share.
This would have course be a frustrating turn of events, especially if you bought into GOOG right after the earnings release. However, if you’re a long-term GOOG shareholder, or if you’ve been sitting on the sidelines, this could be a great opportunity.
Why? Shares are more than reasonably priced at 22.5 times forward earnings. Even a moderate pullback would push shares down to a valuation not too far, if not in, value stock territory. Better yet, such an overreaction could prove short-lived.
In fact, all it may take is another quarter of strong growth to quell “end of Google” fears, and to send shares surging higher once again.
The Verdict: Pounce on Any Weakness That Arises
OpenAI may be an AI first-mover, but it hasn’t been unstoppable in market disruption. After all, a Chat GPT-infused Bing may have beaten Google to the punch, the impact of this on market share has been far less than originally expected . I wouldn’t be writing the obituary for Google search just yet.
You don’t have to wait for the OpenAI search rumors to prove true or not to enter a position. As we have argued recently, even at current prices, it’s well worthwhile to enter a buy-and-hold position .
However, if Sam Altman is giving evasive answers, and OpenAI is gearing up for an AI search launch, don’t dread it, look forward to it. It may just well prove to be the next great opportunity to increase exposure to Alphabet stock on the cheap.
Alphabet stock earns an A rating in Portfolio Grader.

2024-05-14,"If You'd Invested $10,000 in Apple Stock 5 Years Ago, Here's How Much You'd Have Today","Over the past five years, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has risen by 277%, adjusted for a 2020 stock split. But it's also important to note that Apple pays a modest dividend , so assuming reinvestment of all the dividends you received over the past five years, Apple's five-year total return through May 13 was 291%.
So, if you had invested $10,000 in Apple stock five years ago, and had reinvested your dividends along the way, your investment would have grown to about $39,100.

2024-05-14,Apple Stock Alert: Warning! AAPL's Problems Are Getting Worse.,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Apple’s (NASDQ: AAPL ) first-quarter financial results contained some very discouraging signs, making the stock a sell in the near-term. Up until now, it has been easy to defend Apple stock.
Sales of the company’s electronic devices — its iPhones and MacBooks — had been slowing, but the services side of the business — streaming and Apple Pay — more than made up for the shortfall. However, problems are compounding. Apple can’t maintain the growth it has enjoyed since the iPhone was introduced in 2007.
Troubling Numbers
Apple’s Q1 print was poor. So bad that the company distracted from the dismal numbers by announcing it will buyback $110 billion of its own stock.
It’s the largest share repurchase in corporate history. The move worked. Media headlines focused on the stock buyback and not the financial results. Investors have bid the stock up nearly 10% since the earnings were announced.
The new share repurchases represent a 22% increase over last year’s $90 billion authorization. Apple also said it would pay a 25 cent dividend going forward, a one cent increase. While investors cheered the stock buyback program and dividend hike, they overlooked some troubling numbers .
Overall sales in Q1 declined 4% from a year earlier, while iPhone sales, which account for half Apple’s revenue, fell 10% year over year during the quarter.
The poor results weren’t confined to the iPhone. The “other products” segment that includes the Apple Watch and AirPod headphones also saw sales decline 10%.
No indication was given on how sales are performing for the Vision Pro virtual reality headset that went on sale at the start of this year and retails for $3,500. Management declined to provide any forward guidance for the current second quarter.
Pulling Out All The Stops
Apple is doing all it can to right the ship and get its sales and stock growing again. In addition to launching the Vision Pro headset, Apple has unveiled new versions of its iPad Air and iPad Pro tablets and teased a big artificial intelligence announcement at its upcoming June developer conference.
This as CEO Tim Cook embarks on a global tour, visiting China, India and crisscrossing the U.S.
There have also been media reports that Apple is developing microchips to run AI software in data centers and that the company is negotiating with Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG /NASDAQ: GOOGL ) to add that company’s Gemini AI technology to future versions of the iPhone.
A major revamp of the iPhone, possibly to include AI, certainly seems to be needed.
Some analysts and investors are taking the news reports as signs that Apple is quickly recovering. But most of what’s been reported amounts to little more than rumors at this point. Apple needs to get new and exciting products into the hands of consumers.
It’s current product lineup has grown stale. Apple also faces growing competition, especially in markets like China where companies such as Huawei have supplanted it .
Sell AAPL Stock
AAPL stock is down 1% on the year and has only risen 6% in the last 12 months. The company has trailed the bull market of the past year. It has also underperformed vis-à-vis most other megacap technology stocks .
At the recent Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A /NYSE: BRK:B ) annual meeting, it was revealed that Warren Buffett trimmed his stake in Apple by 13%. This came as a shock to many as Buffett has, until now, been one of Apple’s biggest fans and shareholders. Apple accounts for 40% of Berkshire Hathaway’s equity portfolio, its largest holding.
Clearly, Buffett has some concerns about Apple and what is happening with the company right now. Investors should share Buffett’s concern. Apple stock is not a buy.

2024-05-13,Now Even Apple Wants to Make Data Center Chips! Which Are the 3 Best Chipmaker Stocks to Buy?,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is best known for its consumer electronic products that develop a cult-like following. In fact, the tech stock is a formidable chipmaker. The very first in-house chip appeared in the iPhone 4 way back in 2010. Yet today, all Apple computers run on their own processors.
Apple’s chips are for its own consumption though. They don’t sell them to others. And because it relies upon its own designs, it is no longer beholden to other chipmakers for supply. Now Apple isn’t a foundry. It doesn’t physically make its own processors. As so many others do, it turns that function over to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM ).
But currently, Apple is looking to expand. A recent report in The Wall Street Journal said the tech giant was developing its own chips that are designed to run artificial intelligence ( AI ) software in data center servers.
Apple Chips in Data Centers are codenamed ACDC. These processors will target AI inference rather than AI training. The difference between them is with training, the processors develop and refine AI algorithms while inference, take already-trained AI algorithms to use real-world data.
Apple isn’t alone. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) are developing custom inference chips to minimize reliance on third-party chipmakers. But with the field growing more crowded which are the best chipmaker stocks to buy? The three companies below easily make the cut.
Nvidia (NVDA)
Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com
There is no question Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) has to top the list. Its graphics processing units ( GPU ) dominate right now with a 98% share of the data center market , according to Wells Fargo. Although that is expected to drop to between 94% and 96% as rivals bring their own processors to market, Nvidia will still be the industry leader.
Nvidia’s GPUs target the training side of the equation. Its original Tesla and Ampere GPUs were designed to tackle the vast computational challenges AI presented. Its next-generation Hopper GPUs took it to the next level. Those had an ability to deliver sixfold more performance than the Ampere chips. The H100 chips are still seen as the foundational base that other chipmakers aspire to teach AI models. Now the latest iteration is the GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip which triples the bandwidth the H100 offered.
But, it is much more expensive, so adoption may not be as quick. For unparalleled power, hyperscalers may choose the GH200. Yet it opens up a wedge for competitors to offer lower cost chips that can more than get the job done. Still, Nvidia remains the premiere AI chipmaker stock to buy.
Arm Holdings (ARM)
Source: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com
British chip stock Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM ) is not exactly a chipmaker. Rather it develops a chip architecture and a set of instructions that it licenses to customers. Apple’s chips are all ARM processors. The two signed an agreement last year that is extends through 2040 and beyond .
Apple and Arm’s other clients include Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). These companies pay royalties to Arm Holdings on each unit shipped.
ARM’s low power needs have made the chips exceptionally popular with mobile handset manufacturers. Also, it made them in demand for data centers, where energy consumption is increasingly a concern . The large language model chips from Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon all run on Arm’s newest V9 technology. While the primary functions of data centers are performed by GPUs, Arm Holdings chips will run alongside them. So, they will benefit from the growth AI is creating in data center demand.
Indeed, because of Nvidia’s data cen ter dominance, you could see ARM become an integral part of data center architecture. Nvidia’s latest, most advanced chip Grace Blackwell Superchip integrates the chipmaker’s GPUs with Arm Holding’s central processing units ( CPUs ). ARM Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) Rene Haas told analysts , “I think now with Nvidia’s most recent announcement, Grace Blackwell, you are going to see an acceleration of ARM of the data center in these AI applications.”
Since Arm Holdings works, well, arm-in-arm with these chipmakers it will be a top stock to buy .
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)
Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com
If Nvidia and other chipmakers are going to benefit from the rise of AI in data centers, then it’s clear the manufacturer they turn to to actually make the chips must be included as well. As their business grows, so will Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.
As noted above, Apple isn’t making its own chips. TSM makes them. The same is true for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO ) and Qualcomm . TSM is the world’s largest chip foundry pureplay. Because of “insatiable” demand for AI chips, the company forecast sales will grow by low- to mid-20% rates this year with AI accounting for low-teen percentages of revenue.
Supply chain issues and capacity constraints have actually held the chipmaker back over the past few years. However, it is building new factories to meet demand. But a second manufacturing plant in Arizona has been put on hold as rising costs and lack of skilled labor dent progress.
Still, TSM just reported a 60% year-over-year ( YOY ) surge in April sales that also grew 20% jump from March, indicating business is still strong. That makes Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing one of the best chipmaker stocks to buy.

An Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Store strike is coming to Towson, Maryland as members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Coalition of Organized Retail Employees (IAM CORE) voted in favor of the strike .
This strike comes after the union employees have negotiated with Apple for over a year. The IAM CORE members decided on the strike due to the “unsatisfactory outcomes” of these negotiations.
Here’s what the IAM CORE Negotiating Committee said about the Apple Store strike:
“The passage of the strike sanction vote highlights IAM CORE’s unwavering commitment to advocating for the rights and well-being of workers in the face of challenges. As discussions with Apple management continue, we remain committed to securing tangible improvements that benefit all employees.”
Timing of the Apple Store Strike
It’s still not been decided when this Apple Store strike will take place. What is worth noting is that the Towson, Maryland location was the first Apple Store to unionize . Other stores have attempted to do so, but with less success.
This has resulted in conflict between Apple and some of its retail employees. That includes allegations that the tech giant has taken part in union-busting tactics to keep its workers from unionizing.

2024-05-13,"SCHD: Overrated Dividend ETF, Lots Of Downside Risk","The Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) is a decent dividend ETF choice but is overrated due to past performance-driven buying.
The surge in assets into SCHD is likely a result of recency bias and marketing rather than its exceptional performance.
SCHD is not a ""bored ape"" and should be recognized for what it is: a solid plug-in for yield, valuation, and total return growth potential.
The Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF ( SCHD ) is living off of the reputation it gained as a ""best in class"" dividend ETF during a limited period of time. That doesn't make it a bad fund to own.

2024-05-13,Apple Music celebrates the greatest records ever made with the launch of inaugural 100 Best Albums list,"A 10-day countdown kicks off today with the reveal of albums 100-91, featuring works from Solange; Tyler, The Creator; George Michael; and more
Discover, share, and follow along as Apple Music journeys through the albums that shaped, inspired, and fundamentally changed music
Apple Music® today announced the release of its 100 Best Albums of all time, a celebratory list of the greatest records ever made, crafted by Apple Music’s team of experts alongside a select group of artists, including Maren Morris, Pharrell Williams, J Balvin, Charli XCX, Mark Hoppus, Honey Dijon, and Nia Archives, as well as songwriters, producers, and industry professionals. The list is an editorial statement — fully independent of any streaming numbers on Apple Music, a love letter to the records that have shaped the world we live and listen in.
This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240513024769/en/
(Graphic: Apple Inc.)
Apple Music is bringing its 100 Best Albums to life with a countdown celebration beginning today, revealing 10 albums each day for the next 10 days, along with a brand-new 100 Best microsite, new and exclusive content, dedicated Apple Music radio episodes, and so much more. The countdown will culminate on the final day with the reveal of Apple Music’s top 10 albums of all time during a broadcast radio special.
“100 Best brings together all the things that make Apple Music the ultimate service for music lovers — human curation at its peak, an appreciation for the art of storytelling, and unparalleled knowledge of music and an even deeper love for it,” said Rachel Newman, Apple Music’s senior director of content and editorial. “We have been working on this for a very long time, and it’s something we are all incredibly proud of and excited to share with the world.”
“Putting this list together was a true labor of love, both in that it was incredibly difficult to do and in that we are all so passionate about it,” said Zane Lowe, Apple Music’s global creative director and lead anchor for Apple Music 1. “We were tasked with selecting the 100 best — that’s practically mission impossible. But as music fans, it was also amazing to really take a minute and sit and think about the music and albums and artists that we love so much in this context. If this list sparks more debate among fans outside of Apple Music and gets people talking passionately about the music they love, then we’ve done what we set out to do.”
The first 10 albums, revealed today, offer a glimpse into Apple Music’s unique approach with 100 Best. With seven of the 10 records hailing from the 21st century, two from the 90s, only one from the 70s, and various genres represented, the list spotlights contemporary artists like Tyler, The Creator; Robyn; Lorde; Travis Scott; Solange; Burial; and more who have helped define this century through their music and its influence on others.
100. Body Talk , Robyn
99. Hotel California, Eagles
98. ASTROWORLD, Travis Scott
97. Rage Against the Machine , Rage Against the Machine
96. Pure Heroine , Lorde
95 . Confessions , USHER
94. Untrue , Burial
93. A Seat at the Table , Solange
92. Flower Boy , Tyler, The Creator
91. Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1 , George Michael
“There are so many fun facts for our listeners to discover about these albums,” said Scott Plagenhoef, Apple Music’s global head of music programming. “For example, two of the records revealed today were promoted without the image of the artist, but for opposite reasons — Burial’s Untrue because the artist was still operating anonymously at the time, and George Michael’s Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1 because the artist was actually retreating from fame.”
Discover, Learn, and Share with Friends
To accompany the list, today Apple Music also revealed a dedicated microsite that will update every day of the countdown, making it easy for listeners to follow along. Available now at 100best.music.apple.com , the new 100 Best microsite spotlights in-depth analysis of each album, archival interviews, and more, and makes it easy for fans to share their favorite albums with friends and on their social channels.
Explore records 100-91 of Apple Music’s 100 Best Albums at 100best.music.apple.com .
Follow Along on Apple Music Radio
Fans will also be treated to a full 100 Best Albums Radio takeover on Apple Music Hits, broadcasting round-the-clock specials with Apple Music Radio hosts, daily specials at 9 a.m. PT (noon ET), plus exclusive content dropping every day on demand on Apple Music and Apple Podcasts.
The last 10 albums will be revealed on Wednesday, May 22, with a special roundtable discussion broadcasting globally on Apple Music that features guest artists Nile Rodgers and Maggie Rogers reflecting on the list alongside Apple Music’s own Zane Lowe and Ebro Darden. Lowe will also curate a special mashup-style DJ mix featuring songs from all 100 Best Albums.
Apple Music will keep the momentum going after the countdown ends with an additional week of 100 Best Albums Radio takeover on Apple Music Hits.
All 100 Best Album recipients will be given an award comprised of blasted anodized aluminum, sourced entirely from recycled Apple products, in a unique polished PVD gold. The design on the back of the award takes its cues from a vinyl LP record and is inscribed with the artist’s name, album’s title, and album’s year of release.

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) just hit the earnings tape with one major headline: a $110 billion stock buyback authorization. This is a notable announcement, as it marks the largest share buyback in U.S. corporate history.
Let's break down why stock buybacks are important, and analyze some of the other themes of Apple's earnings. After a thorough review of the report, you may want to think twice before scooping up shares of the iPhone maker.
The chart below illustrates Apple's stock buyback history over the last 10 years. Clearly, the company has done a stellar job returning capital to investors through a series of consistent stock buybacks :",9

2024-05-12,Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has delivered impressive gains to investors over the past five years, with shares of the tech giant rising close to 250% during this period and outpacing the S&P 500 index's gains of 77% by a big margin. The "" Magnificent Seven "" stock's robust rally can be attributed to the growing prominence of its high-margin services business, as well as a tremendous smartphone upgrade cycle triggered by the arrival of 5G smartphones.
However, Apple stock has lost its luster in 2024. It is down nearly 5%, and has underperformed the S&P 500 so far.
Berkshire Hathaway , led by celebrated investor Warren Buffett, has reduced its Apple stake by 13%. Moreover, analysts and investors are concerned that Apple has been late to capitalize on hot tech trends such as artificial intelligence (AI). Rivals such as Samsung are using AI to boost smartphone sales, while Apple's latest results indicate that the demand for iPhones is waning.",9
2024-05-14,"If You'd Invested $10,000 in Apple Stock 5 Years Ago, Here's How Much You'd Have Today","Over the past five years, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has risen by 277%, adjusted for a 2020 stock split. But it's also important to note that Apple pays a modest dividend , so assuming reinvestment of all the dividends you received over the past five years, Apple's five-year total return through May 13 was 291%.
So, if you had invested $10,000 in Apple stock five years ago, and had reinvested your dividends along the way, your investment would have grown to about $39,100.
To put it mildly, this is extraordinary performance. A 291% total return over a five-year period translates to 31% annualized total returns. Meanwhile, the long-term average of the S&P 500 is about 10%.",10
2024-05-14,Apple Stock Alert: Warning! AAPL's Problems Are Getting Worse.,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Apple’s (NASDQ: AAPL ) first-quarter financial results contained some very discouraging signs, making the stock a sell in the near-term. Up until now, it has been easy to defend Apple stock.
Sales of the company’s electronic devices — its iPhones and MacBooks — had been slowing, but the services side of the business — streaming and Apple Pay — more than made up for the shortfall. However, problems are compounding. Apple can’t maintain the growth it has enjoyed since the iPhone was introduced in 2007.
Troubling Numbers
Apple’s Q1 print was poor. So bad that the company distracted from the dismal numbers by announcing it will buyback $110 billion of its own stock.
It’s the largest share repurchase in corporate history. The move worked. Media headlines focused on the stock buyback and not the financial results. Investors have bid the stock up nearly 10% since the earnings were announced.
The new share repurchases represent a 22% increase over last year’s $90 billion authorization. Apple also said it would pay a 25 cent dividend going forward, a one cent increase. While investors cheered the stock buyback program and dividend hike, they overlooked some troubling numbers .
Overall sales in Q1 declined 4% from a year earlier, while iPhone sales, which account for half Apple’s revenue, fell 10% year over year during the quarter.
The poor results weren’t confined to the iPhone. The “other products” segment that includes the Apple Watch and AirPod headphones also saw sales decline 10%.
No indication was given on how sales are performing for the Vision Pro virtual reality headset that went on sale at the start of this year and retails for $3,500. Management declined to provide any forward guidance for the current second quarter.
Pulling Out All The Stops
Apple is doing all it can to right the ship and get its sales and stock growing again. In addition to launching the Vision Pro headset, Apple has unveiled new versions of its iPad Air and iPad Pro tablets and teased a big artificial intelligence announcement at its upcoming June developer conference.
This as CEO Tim Cook embarks on a global tour, visiting China, India and crisscrossing the U.S.
There have also been media reports that Apple is developing microchips to run AI software in data centers and that the company is negotiating with Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG /NASDAQ: GOOGL ) to add that company’s Gemini AI technology to future versions of the iPhone.
A major revamp of the iPhone, possibly to include AI, certainly seems to be needed.
Some analysts and investors are taking the news reports as signs that Apple is quickly recovering. But most of what’s been reported amounts to little more than rumors at this point. Apple needs to get new and exciting products into the hands of consumers.
It’s current product lineup has grown stale. Apple also faces growing competition, especially in markets like China where companies such as Huawei have supplanted it .
Sell AAPL Stock
AAPL stock is down 1% on the year and has only risen 6% in the last 12 months. The company has trailed the bull market of the past year. It has also underperformed vis-à-vis most other megacap technology stocks .
At the recent Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A /NYSE: BRK:B ) annual meeting, it was revealed that Warren Buffett trimmed his stake in Apple by 13%. This came as a shock to many as Buffett has, until now, been one of Apple’s biggest fans and shareholders. Apple accounts for 40% of Berkshire Hathaway’s equity portfolio, its largest holding.
Clearly, Buffett has some concerns about Apple and what is happening with the company right now. Investors should share Buffett’s concern. Apple stock is not a buy.

2024-05-13,Now Even Apple Wants to Make Data Center Chips! Which Are the 3 Best Chipmaker Stocks to Buy?,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is best known for its consumer electronic products that develop a cult-like following. In fact, the tech stock is a formidable chipmaker. The very first in-house chip appeared in the iPhone 4 way back in 2010. Yet today, all Apple computers run on their own processors.
Apple’s chips are for its own consumption though. They don’t sell them to others. And because it relies upon its own designs, it is no longer beholden to other chipmakers for supply. Now Apple isn’t a foundry. It doesn’t physically make its own processors. As so many others do, it turns that function over to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM ).
But currently, Apple is looking to expand. A recent report in The Wall Street Journal said the tech giant was developing its own chips that are designed to run artificial intelligence ( AI ) software in data center servers.
Apple Chips in Data Centers are codenamed ACDC. These processors will target AI inference rather than AI training. The difference between them is with training, the processors develop and refine AI algorithms while inference, take already-trained AI algorithms to use real-world data.
Apple isn’t alone. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) are developing custom inference chips to minimize reliance on third-party chipmakers. But with the field growing more crowded which are the best chipmaker stocks to buy? The three companies below easily make the cut.
Nvidia (NVDA)
Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com
There is no question Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) has to top the list. Its graphics processing units ( GPU ) dominate right now with a 98% share of the data center market , according to Wells Fargo. Although that is expected to drop to between 94% and 96% as rivals bring their own processors to market, Nvidia will still be the industry leader.
Nvidia’s GPUs target the training side of the equation. Its original Tesla and Ampere GPUs were designed to tackle the vast computational challenges AI presented. Its next-generation Hopper GPUs took it to the next level. Those had an ability to deliver sixfold more performance than the Ampere chips. The H100 chips are still seen as the foundational base that other chipmakers aspire to teach AI models. Now the latest iteration is the GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip which triples the bandwidth the H100 offered.
But, it is much more expensive, so adoption may not be as quick. For unparalleled power, hyperscalers may choose the GH200. Yet it opens up a wedge for competitors to offer lower cost chips that can more than get the job done. Still, Nvidia remains the premiere AI chipmaker stock to buy.
Arm Holdings (ARM)

British chip stock Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM ) is not exactly a chipmaker. Rather it develops a chip architecture and a set of instructions that it licenses to customers. Apple’s chips are all ARM processors. The two signed an agreement last year that is extends through 2040 and beyond .
Apple and Arm’s other clients include Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). These companies pay royalties to Arm Holdings on each unit shipped.
ARM’s low power needs have made the chips exceptionally popular with mobile handset manufacturers. Also, it made them in demand for data centers, where energy consumption is increasingly a concern . The large language model chips from Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon all run on Arm’s newest V9 technology. While the primary functions of data centers are performed by GPUs, Arm Holdings chips will run alongside them. So, they will benefit from the growth AI is creating in data center demand.
Indeed, because of Nvidia’s data cen ter dominance, you could see ARM become an integral part of data center architecture. Nvidia’s latest, most advanced chip Grace Blackwell Superchip integrates the chipmaker’s GPUs with Arm Holding’s central processing units ( CPUs ). ARM Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) Rene Haas told analysts , “I think now with Nvidia’s most recent announcement, Grace Blackwell, you are going to see an acceleration of ARM of the data center in these AI applications.”
Since Arm Holdings works, well, arm-in-arm with these chipmakers it will be a top stock to buy .
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)

If Nvidia and other chipmakers are going to benefit from the rise of AI in data centers, then it’s clear the manufacturer they turn to to actually make the chips must be included as well. As their business grows, so will Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.
As noted above, Apple isn’t making its own chips. TSM makes them. The same is true for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO ) and Qualcomm . TSM is the world’s largest chip foundry pureplay. Because of “insatiable” demand for AI chips, the company forecast sales will grow by low- to mid-20% rates this year with AI accounting for low-teen percentages of revenue.
Supply chain issues and capacity constraints have actually held the chipmaker back over the past few years. However, it is building new factories to meet demand. But a second manufacturing plant in Arizona has been put on hold as rising costs and lack of skilled labor dent progress.
Still, TSM just reported a 60% year-over-year ( YOY ) surge in April sales that also grew 20% jump from March, indicating business is still strong. That makes Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing one of the best chipmaker stocks to buy.

An Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Store strike is coming to Towson, Maryland as members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Coalition of Organized Retail Employees (IAM CORE) voted in favor of the strike .
This strike comes after the union employees have negotiated with Apple for over a year. The IAM CORE members decided on the strike due to the “unsatisfactory outcomes” of these negotiations.
Here’s what the IAM CORE Negotiating Committee said about the Apple Store strike:
“The passage of the strike sanction vote highlights IAM CORE’s unwavering commitment to advocating for the rights and well-being of workers in the face of challenges. As discussions with Apple management continue, we remain committed to securing tangible improvements that benefit all employees.”
Timing of the Apple Store Strike
It’s still not been decided when this Apple Store strike will take place. What is worth noting is that the Towson, Maryland location was the first Apple Store to unionize . Other stores have attempted to do so, but with less success.
This has resulted in conflict between Apple and some of its retail employees. That includes allegations that the tech giant has taken part in union-busting tactics to keep its workers from unionizing.
AAPL stock is up 1.7% as of Monday morning.

Discover, share, and follow along as Apple Music journeys through the albums that shaped, inspired, and fundamentally changed music
Apple Music® today announced the release of its 100 Best Albums of all time, a celebratory list of the greatest records ever made, crafted by Apple Music’s team of experts alongside a select group of artists, including Maren Morris, Pharrell Williams, J Balvin, Charli XCX, Mark Hoppus, Honey Dijon, and Nia Archives, as well as songwriters, producers, and industry professionals. The list is an editorial statement — fully independent of any streaming numbers on Apple Music, a love letter to the records that have shaped the world we live and listen in.
This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240513024769/en/
(Graphic: Apple Inc.)
Apple Music is bringing its 100 Best Albums to life with a countdown celebration beginning today, revealing 10 albums each day for the next 10 days, along with a brand-new 100 Best microsite, new and exclusive content, dedicated Apple Music radio episodes, and so much more. The countdown will culminate on the final day with the reveal of Apple Music’s top 10 albums of all time during a broadcast radio special.
“100 Best brings together all the things that make Apple Music the ultimate service for music lovers — human curation at its peak, an appreciation for the art of storytelling, and unparalleled knowledge of music and an even deeper love for it,” said Rachel Newman, Apple Music’s senior director of content and editorial. “We have been working on this for a very long time, and it’s something we are all incredibly proud of and excited to share with the world.”
“Putting this list together was a true labor of love, both in that it was incredibly difficult to do and in that we are all so passionate about it,” said Zane Lowe, Apple Music’s global creative director and lead anchor for Apple Music 1. “We were tasked with selecting the 100 best — that’s practically mission impossible. But as music fans, it was also amazing to really take a minute and sit and think about the music and albums and artists that we love so much in this context. If this list sparks more debate among fans outside of Apple Music and gets people talking passionately about the music they love, then we’ve done what we set out to do.”
The first 10 albums, revealed today, offer a glimpse into Apple Music’s unique approach with 100 Best. With seven of the 10 records hailing from the 21st century, two from the 90s, only one from the 70s, and various genres represented, the list spotlights contemporary artists like Tyler, The Creator; Robyn; Lorde; Travis Scott; Solange; Burial; and more who have helped define this century through their music and its influence on others.
100. Body Talk , Robyn
99. Hotel California, Eagles
98. ASTROWORLD, Travis Scott
97. Rage Against the Machine , Rage Against the Machine
96. Pure Heroine , Lorde
95 . Confessions , USHER
94. Untrue , Burial
93. A Seat at the Table , Solange
92. Flower Boy , Tyler, The Creator
91. Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1 , George Michael
“There are so many fun facts for our listeners to discover about these albums,” said Scott Plagenhoef, Apple Music’s global head of music programming. “For example, two of the records revealed today were promoted without the image of the artist, but for opposite reasons — Burial’s Untrue because the artist was still operating anonymously at the time, and George Michael’s Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1 because the artist was actually retreating from fame.”
Discover, Learn, and Share with Friends
To accompany the list, today Apple Music also revealed a dedicated microsite that will update every day of the countdown, making it easy for listeners to follow along. Available now at 100best.music.apple.com , the new 100 Best microsite spotlights in-depth analysis of each album, archival interviews, and more, and makes it easy for fans to share their favorite albums with friends and on their social channels.
Explore records 100-91 of Apple Music’s 100 Best Albums at 100best.music.apple.com .
Follow Along on Apple Music Radio
Fans will also be treated to a full 100 Best Albums Radio takeover on Apple Music Hits, broadcasting round-the-clock specials with Apple Music Radio hosts, daily specials at 9 a.m. PT (noon ET), plus exclusive content dropping every day on demand on Apple Music and Apple Podcasts.
The last 10 albums will be revealed on Wednesday, May 22, with a special roundtable discussion broadcasting globally on Apple Music that features guest artists Nile Rodgers and Maggie Rogers reflecting on the list alongside Apple Music’s own Zane Lowe and Ebro Darden. Lowe will also curate a special mashup-style DJ mix featuring songs from all 100 Best Albums.
Apple Music will keep the momentum going after the countdown ends with an additional week of 100 Best Albums Radio takeover on Apple Music Hits.
All 100 Best Album recipients will be given an award comprised of blasted anodized aluminum, sourced entirely from recycled Apple products, in a unique polished PVD gold. The design on the back of the award takes its cues from a vinyl LP record and is inscribed with the artist’s name, album’s title, and album’s year of release.

2024-05-12,Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has delivered impressive gains to investors over the past five years, with shares of the tech giant rising close to 250% during this period and outpacing the S&P 500 index's gains of 77% by a big margin. The "" Magnificent Seven "" stock's robust rally can be attributed to the growing prominence of its high-margin services business, as well as a tremendous smartphone upgrade cycle triggered by the arrival of 5G smartphones.
However, Apple stock has lost its luster in 2024. It is down nearly 5%, and has underperformed the S&P 500 so far.
Berkshire Hathaway , led by celebrated investor Warren Buffett, has reduced its Apple stake by 13%. Moreover, analysts and investors are concerned that Apple has been late to capitalize on hot tech trends such as artificial intelligence (AI).

2024-05-12,AAPL Analysis: Why Apple Stock Dipped in Q2 and What's Ahead for Q3,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has yet to make its move in artificial intelligence and Apple stock is suffering for it. Shares were $165 before its most recent earnings announcement. Those numbers weren’t great . Sales and net income were both down slightly. A $110 billion buyback and a 25 cent/share dividend, the stock still rose, trading above $183.
It’s now down just $4/share from where it started the year, at $181/share. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), which recently passed it to become the world’s most valuable company, has extended its lead to $250 billion.
The great growth story of the 2010s is now just another value stock. Is this ever going to change?
Boring Into Apple Stock
Based on its May 7 iPad announcements the answer is no.
A thinner model, a better screen, and an electric pencil won’t move the needle. Reporters were reduced to commenting on CEO Tim Cook’s sneakers .
Apple has tried to evolve the iPad into a PC replacement, but it’s not working . Let’s not even start about the Vision Pro headset , now being pitched as a business tool .
Based on all this, why did I recently buy more Apple stock?
Waiting for WWDC
The reason will be announced June 10 at its Worldwide Developer Conference. That’s when we expect to hear Apple’s vision for AI.
There are already some hints. Project ACDC will put Apple AI chips in its data centers , with manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM ) already on the case.
The new chips will work on AI inference , answering questions from AI data rather than training the data itself.
This tells me Apple will focus on what’s now called “AI PCs,” performing intelligent tasks on clients rather than just servers. But rather than put AI on your desk, where the Mac is less relevant by the day, Apple will put AI into the iPhone.
Apple is all about interfaces. The key iPhone interfaces for AI right now look to be the Siri voice assistant and its messaging app. Expect the WWDC announcements to focus on software, like its Dynamic Island alert service and messaging.
Building AI into its entire product line, including the Vision Pro and Watch, will give Apple a holistic approach to AI. Most users today live in a mixed reality of PCs and Android phones, of FitBit watches and Xbox game machines. This may be a chance to make some converts.
Apple is talking to Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) about using its Gemini models in the cloud , but will build the interfaces and client software itself. Developers will then be let loose to build applications, and final hardware decisions will be seen in September at the iPhone 16 launch .
The Bottom Line
AI is upending the tech market like nothing since the Internet itself. But most analysts are still defining it based on the current paradigm of client, server, and cloud.
History says this is a mistake. Most leaders of the early Internet boom don’t exist today. It was of course the Cloud Czars who won the game, investing in the behind-the-scenes infrastructure needed to bring the 1990s’ promise to market.
That’s what all the Cloud Czar investors now fear, including those of us in Apple. Will AI be something you talk to? Will it be an application or an app like everything is now? Or will it be something immersive like the sci-fi of the 1980s ?
Truth is, we don’t know. This latest iteration of the Great Game is just starting, and not all of today’s industry leaders will make it through. But I’d rather bet on an expert in interfaces. I want one with plenty of cash to invest in figuring things out.
The time to get in on this opportunity is before it is realized, in the calm before the storm.

2024-05-12,Warren Buffett Has Trimmed 13% of His Apple Stock. Should You?,"The first weekend in May marked the yearly investing pilgrimage as tens of thousands of value investors congregated in Omaha for the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) annual meeting. They went to ask questions and listen to answers from the legendary investor Warren Buffett while also paying tribute to the passing of his late partner, Charlie Munger. Buffett answered dozens of questions throughout the weekend, but it was perhaps a different news item that got the most headlines: He sold some of his Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) position.
The largest holding in his gargantuan stock portfolio, Apple is one of the businesses Buffett has praised for their high quality ever since greatly increasing his position a little over five years ago. Now -- for reasons I will get into -- he decided to lower his exposure to the consumer electronics giant.

Spikes in inflation in 2023 caused reductions in consumer spending, leading Apple to post four consecutive quarters of revenue declines.

2024-05-11,The 3 Best Mutual Funds to Buy in May 2024,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
For investors looking to avoid the hassle and stress of picking individual stocks, the best mutual funds to buy remain a great option. These funds are comprised of pooled investments. A fund manager manages a mutual fund. These fund managers pick stocks and other investments, and determine their weighting within the fund. As they are actively managed, mutual funds tend to come with higher fees than more passive exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and self-managed portfolios.
While not for everyone, mutual funds can still prove to be a great choice for people who are not comfortable managing their own investments or who don’t want to spend the time needed to research and choose individual stocks. Some mutual funds track select stock market indexes such as the S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100, delivering nearly identical returns. There are also sector specific mutual funds and funds that focus on stocks in specific countries. Whatever a person’s interest, there’s sure to be a mutual fund to meet it.
Here are the three best mutual funds to buy in May 2024.
Vanguard Global Dividend Fund (VIC200)
The Vanguard Global Dividend Fund aims to provide an above-average level of investment income combined with long-term capital growth. The fund invested in high-paying dividend stocks of companies that are situated around the world in order to acheive this objective. Top holdings in the fund include stocks such as Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ) and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) in the United States, and TotalEnergies (NYSE: TTE ) and Novartis (NYSE: NVS ) situated in Europe.
Most of the stocks held in the Vanguard Global Dividend Fund have a dividend yield of 2.50% or greater, as well as a history of steadily increasing their payouts to shareholders. Vanguard manages it and this mutual fund comes with the Vanguard’s low fees. The current management fee associated with the fund is 0.31%, much less than most other actively managed mutual funds. The fund also pays its owners a quarterly dividend payment of 10 cents per unit held. Over the last 12 months, the fund has returned 16%.
iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV)

The iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA: IVV ) is run by asset manager BlackRock (NYSE: BLK ). This mutual fund tracks the performance of the S&P 500 index that is comprised of the 500 biggest publicly traded stocks in the U.S. by market capitalization. With the stock market currently in a bull run, the returns on this mutual fund have been excellent over the last year, rising 30%. Through five years, the fund has returned a decent 15% to investors.
As it tracks the S&P 500, the fund’s holdings are the mega-cap stocks that dominate the index, including Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ). Another attractive feature of the fund is its ultra low fees . Currently, BlackRock is charging a management fee of only 0.03%, which is rock bottom for a mutual fund. The iShares Core S&P 500 ETF also pays a quarterly dividend of $1.67 per unit held. For investors wanting a passive way to track the market, this is a great option.
Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX)

The Fidelity Contrafund (MUTF: FCNTX ) says that its objective is to invest in stocks of companies whose value is not fully recognized by the public. That said, the fund is heavily weighted to mega-cap tech . Top holdings include Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), among other well-known names. The composition of the fund appears to be working with it delivering a 36% return over the last 12 months.
Through five years, this mutual fund has returned 15% to investors . The expense ratio of 0.39% is not the lowest around. However, it is reasonable given the returns. There is no minimum investment amount required with the Fidelity Contrafund. However, if there’s one drawback with this fund it is that it does not pay a dividend. Still, the returns provided are very strong. Already in 2024, the Contrafund has delivered an 18% gain, which is better than the 10% ytd return of the benchmark S&P 500 index. If you are looking for the best mutual funds to buy, start here.

The Reason Why Is Eye-Opening.,"Warren Buffett and his team at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) have been nearly synonymous with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) since taking a position in the stock in 2014. The investment (and all the stock they bought along the way) turned out to be smart and made Berkshire a substantial profit.
However, Berkshire has started to sell Apple stock despite voicing its belief in the business. At one point, Apple made up more than half of Berkshire's investment portfolio; now, it has retreated to less than 40%.

2024-05-10,The 3 Best Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy in May 2024,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Blue-chip stocks all have common denominators that set them apart from other, lesser stocks. They tend to be big, successful businesses that consumers and investors hold in high regard. Their financial statements are typically exemplary, indicating a level of consistency and stability that can allow shareholders to sleep soundly.
Look over the higher-end market caps of S&P 500 stocks and you’ll get a sense of the companies referred to as “blue-chip.” And what you’ll see that they are doing pretty well.
So far in 2024, blue chip stocks are outperforming both the broad-based index and the small-cap Russell 2000 index. For example, the Fidelity Blue Chip Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: FBCG ) is up over 16% year-to-date versus 9% for the S&P 500 and less than 2% for the small-cap index.
Finding the best blue-chip stocks to buy could be as easy as buying an exchange-traded fund ( ETF ). You get instant diversification at a relatively low cost. The Fidelity ETF has an expense ratio of just 0.48% and gives you access to over 300 blue-chip stocks.
But as stock pickers, I like to think we can do better. Below are three blue-chip stocks that are currently undervalued and should provide your portfolio with a fine balance of growth and income.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com
Shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) are down 5% in 2024 and until last week were sitting down more than 13%. Slowing sales in China, iPhone sales not lighting any fires and lagging development in artificial intelligence ( AI ) all conspired to depress the tech stock’s shares.
Yet it just held an iPad event that promises to reignite tablet sales. It has also been deemphasizing China while moving forcefully into India. Weaning itself away from China into more emergent markets could light that fire investors are looking for. An upcoming developers conference bodes well for AI becoming a force for the tech stock as well as the newest iteration of the iPhone. It promises to be feature-rich in AI.
And the reason Apple stock bounded higher last week was its announcement of a massive $110 billion share buyback plan . The tech company has so much cash sitting on its balance sheet it doesn’t know what to do with it. While stock repurchases artificially juice earnings per share, it can also signal management’s belief its own stock is undervalued.
Apple stock still trades at a premium of 28 times trailing earnings and 7x sales, but as the industry leader, it deserves its premium. With the catalysts outlined above, this blue-chip stock should soon be running higher again.
Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD)
Source: legacy1995 / Shutterstock.com
Although U.S. beer sales continue to slow, Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE: BUD ) remains an industry behemoth with a vast, global reach. Its recent earnings report indicates just how resilient it can be because of its far-flung operations.
Even as volumes continue falling in the U.S., due in part to A-B’s ill-advised decision to wade into the cultural wars, it showed its strength elsewhere. Volumes jumped by mid-single digits in Latin America core brands including Modelo and Pacifico, driving higher sales in Mexico. Corona did likewise in Brazil.
Constellation Brands (NYSE: STZ ) reaps all the benefits of the Modelo and Corona momentum in the U.S., as BUD sold the domestic rights to the brands to gain passage of its acquisition of the brewer. However, A-B retains them elsewhere in the world.
Anheuser-Busch reported a 5% increase in EBITDA to $4.9 billion, which was well above Wall Street’s estimates, while profit margins expanded 90 basis points.
As happened with Apple, shares of A-B jumped on the good news, easing some of the losses experienced in 2024. BUD stock is down less than 3% this year and at less than 2x sales, it is a historically low valuation. These are levels not seen in over a decade, except for during the pandemic. It marks an excellent time to buy this brewer’s blue-chip stock.
Toyota Motor (TM)
Source: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com
Toyota Motor (NYSE: TM ) is redefining the global auto industry with its big bet on hybrid vehicles. When the rest of the world was going all-in on all-electric cars, Toyota hedged its bets with hybrids . It believed consumers would want the reliability of a gas-powered engine to support an electric option. Its choice proved right.
While battery-electric vehicle ( BEV ) growth is dramatically slowing, hybrid sales are exploding. Toyota saw a dramatic 20% surge in first-quarter sales volume. It says EVs now account for 36.6% of its total sales.
Overall, though, the Japanese automaker’s vehicles are proving popular. That’s led to it having to use fewer incentives to get buyers to purchase, which improves Toyota’s bottom line. It is also building more factories in more countries, which will help it offset currency exchange rate effects now that the Japanese yen is so strong. Foreign exchange impacts were in part the reason Toyota guided toward a 20% decline in operating profits for the full year.
Toyota’s compact, fuel-efficient and forward-thinking vehicles have struck a chord with car buyers. Until battery technology catches up with buyer demand, Toyota is investing in new solid-state battery technology . This gives them the ability to purchase fossil-fuel-powered options is a smart strategy.
Toyota stock is up 24% year-to-date and 61% higher over the past year. Yet shares still trade at less than 10 times earnings and estimates and at a fraction of sales. While that’s in line with its U.S. counterparts, Toyota Motor sales exhibit robust strength. That makes it the blue-chip stock to buy.

2024-05-10,Earnings-Proof Tech Plays: 3 Stocks Set to Stay Hot Beyond Reporting Season,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Depending on where you look, there has been quite a tough crowd of investors to please this earnings season. Indeed, some companies still managed to blow away the numbers. But many firms ran into a road bump, with softer guidance causing investors to sell, even as the quarterly numbers came in just fine (or even ahead of expectations).
Indeed, there are unique applaud-worthy cases, like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), which sweetened its quarterly showing with a record-breaking share buyback on top of a better-than-expected quarter. Still, not every firm has pockets deep enough to buy back $110 billion worth of shares to top off an already sweet quarter.
Expecting higher guidance alongside big earnings and sales beats every quarter is unrealistic. Even the best companies can’t pull it off every earnings season. As expectations get too high, so do the potential downside risks of falling short going into earnings season.
Three earnings-resilient tech stocks will stay hot after their recent quarterly showings. Though no firm is immune from post-earnings plunges, I see each firm as having plenty of gas in the tank to keep going strong in the second half.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com
There was a lot to look at in the latest quarterly results for Apple. The big headline was, of course, the historic buyback. Beyond that, iPhone sales were looking rather sluggish, and China remained a notable weak spot (not as weak as expected, though) as economic headwinds and competition weighed.
That said, Apple CEO Tim Cook sounded optimistic about the Chinese market. Along with a Greater Chinese result (8% year-over-year fall in revenue) that was better than feared, things may just be looking up for Apple after many months’ worth of ominous headlines that shed light on the fact the iPhone is no longer the number-one smartphone seller in China.
Undoubtedly, the iPhone has been facing a great deal of competitive pressures in China of late. But just because the iPhone slipped from the top spot in the region does not mean it can’t be regained in the future. Perhaps Apple will succeed more with its iPhone 16 in China if it’s packed with innovations that set it apart.
Either way, I find expectations for the iPhone in China to still be quite muted and wouldn’t be surprised if the latest, surprisingly decent quarter helps AAPL stock sustain a return to its all-time highs again. Apple may not be “earnings-proof,” but it is worth holding through even the most jittery of earnings seasons. The latest numbers show us why it’s a bad idea to “play” the stock ahead of earnings.
American Express (AXP)
Source: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com
American Express (NYSE: AXP ) is another blue chip that really surprised to the upside when it reported this earnings season. Unlike Apple, AXP stock was going into its quarterly reveal after a pretty sizeable run that started when shares bottomed in October 2023. The rally is still on, and the latest results are well ahead of expectations. And I think it could have legs until the next round of American Express earnings.
For the latest (first) quarter, the credit card giant showed great discipline in controlling costs. Additionally, net revenue surged 11% to $15.8 billion, a very impressive showing for the $172 billion behemoth.
Once again, younger consumers helped drive the results. As the company enhances its focus on bringing on younger people aboard American Express, I’d not be surprised if the firm had a few more upside surprises up its sleeves.
American Express CEO Steve Squeri is a great boss. He’s serious about attracting younger clients, which is key to sustaining its growth. Younger people are spending a lot of money, and many will be enticed to swipe their American Express cards for great perks and points.
Eli Lilly (LLY)
Source: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi
Like American Express, Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY ) stock had quite a bit of multi-month momentum riding behind it ahead of earnings. Expectations were undoubtedly high, yet Eli Lilly still delivered an impressive showing.
For the first quarter, Lilly beat the bottom line while raising its full-year guidance for sales and adjusted earnings. The classic beat and raise helped LLY stock rise initially, though not by enough to break out of the $730-790 consolidation channel it had been stuck in since February 2024. Indeed, weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, were the show’s stars, helping Lilly move the needle higher (forgive the pun) on sales.
With a hefty valuation (59.2 times forward price-to-earnings) and lots of weight-loss drug hype still baked in, it’s unclear what it’ll take to help LLY stock break out past $800 per share. Perhaps more promising results from its phase-three diabetes drug could help investors rally behind the name.

2024-05-10,Monumental Funding Has Elon Musk AI Venture Primed For Takeoff,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Editor’s Note: This article was previously published under the title, “Learn How to Profit From Elon Musk’s $18 Billion AI Project” but has been updated to include the most recent information.
For years, one of the world’s richest men and arguably most influential tech visionary – Elon Musk – has mostly watched the AI Boom unfold from the sidelines.
That all changes now – quite literally as soon as next week.
That’s because just this past week, reports emerged suggesting that, any day now, Musk is set to secure up to $6 billion in funding for his new AI startup xAI.
Now, Musk founded xAI about a year ago. And to date, the company has done very little. Aside from launching its AI chatbot Grok – which many experts say matches up pound-for-pound with ChatGPT – things have been mostly quiet since xAI’s founding.
But this $6 billion funding round could change that in a dramatic way.
Of course, the thing about world-changing businesses is that they start with world-changing people. Those folks have revolutionary ideas. And when funded with billions of dollars, they turn those ideas into world-changing businesses.
After all, Apple ( AAPL ) only became what it is today thanks to Steve Jobs, who came up with the idea of the iPhone. Jobs then leveraged the enormous amount of money Apple was making off its computers to create the iPhone. And voila… Apple became a trillion-dollar company.
Similarly, Microsoft ( MSFT ) grew into a tech titan because of Bill Gates, who came up with the idea for Windows. Gates used the money Microsoft was making off its PCs to further develop Windows. And that allowed Microsoft to become a trillion-dollar company.
World-changing people with ample resources create world-changing businesses.
So… if you want to invest in world-changing businesses… start with the world-changing people gathering the resources necessary to bring their visions to life.
That is exactly the situation we have with Elon Musk and xAI today.
Invest in a World-Changer Like Elon Musk
We certainly believe that Elon Musk is a world-changer.
He co-founded PayPal ( PYPL ), the world’s largest digital payment platform, now worth nearly $70 billion…
And SpaceX , the world’s largest private space rocket firm, now worth about $180 billion.
He pioneered one of the world’s largest automakers in Tesla ( TSLA )…
And he’s also the man behind Neuralink , The Boring Company , and X .
Musk has influenced how we pay for things, what cars we drive, how we communicate online, how we see space…
I’d venture to say that he is one of the most influential business figures of the past 20 years.
A great example of world-changing.
And now this world-changing person has not only turned his focus to a new business venture at the heart of possibly the most transformative technology the world has ever seen. He’s also on the verge of reportedly acquiring $6 billion in funding to turn his AI vision into a reality.
Would you bet against him here – especially if he gets $6 billion next week to fund this operation?
I don’t think I would.
The Final Word
As we mentioned earlier, xAI has already launched its own impressive AI chatbot. And it did that with very little outside funding. Just imagine what Musk and company will be able to cook up with $6 billion in outside funding.
When all is said and done, xAI could be Elon Musk’s biggest venture yet – his signature mark on the world, if you will.
And right now, you have an opportunity to invest in xAI before this company takes off.
Now, it’s not a direct investment, per se. After all, xAI is barely a year old. It’s still a private startup, which means you can’t buy its stock anywhere.
But we have found a potentially huge “backdoor” investment into xAI. It’s a stock that you likely have never heard of before – but we think it could be the leading tech component supplier for this burgeoning AI titan.
If xAI does win the multi-trillion-dollar AI race… and Elon Musk does it again… then this stock could absolutely soar.
Get all the details about this potential future winner right now.

2024-05-10,The 3 Best Auto Stocks to Buy in May 2024,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The auto sector is entering an exciting and more lucrative era. That’s because automakers are starting to charge subscription fees for high-tech services. I believe that these companies will soon also start offering to track the well-being of various components within vehicles in exchange for fees. Which may transform them into the one of the best auto stocks investors want to buy. Of course, for the owners of electric vehicles, keeping informed about the welfare and needs of their EV’s batteries is extremely important. As a result, I’m sure that many owners will be willing to pay to stay on top of those matters.
Importantly, most consumers seem willing to pay monthly fees for services within their vehicles. But they often like to try out these services first. In July 2023, S&P polled roughly 4,500 consumers who had a free trial or a subscription for services within their vehicles. More than 80% of the respondents said they would consider purchasing subscription-based services in the future. For investors who want to profit from this trend, here are the three best auto stocks to buy.
General Motors (GM)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
Modern electric vehicles are much more computerized than their gas-powered counterparts. Lucid Motors (NASDAQ: LCID ) CEO Peter Rawlinson explained in 2021 that computing has become central to vehicles, especially EVs. As a result, it’s much easier to offer software-based services through EVs than gas-powered vehicles. Consequently, automakers that sell many EVs will be much better positioned to offer software subscriptions.
Among the veteran automakers, General Motors (NYSE: GM ) is one of the best positioned firms to become a top seller of EVs. Sales of the Cadillac Lyriq luxury SUV jumped 500% last quarter year-over-year to 5,800. The Chevrolet Bolt was a top-selling EV in the U.S before it was taken off the market. However, GM is slated to release a retooled version of the Bolt next year . Moreover, the automaker has begun selling electric versions of many of its most popular trucks and SUVs. I believe that these will become best sellers in the longer term. Boding well for the future, GM expects its North American EV business to enter the black in the second half of this year.
Finally, GM reported very strong first-quarter results, has a very low valuation, and is returning a great deal of cash to its shareholders.
Rivian (RIVN)
Source: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com
How can anyone not love a company that’s an integral partner of both Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL )?
It appears that EV maker Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN ) could be on the verge of achieving that huge milestone. As of last October, the start-up had provided Amazon with 10,000 of the delivery vans that the e-commerce giant has ordered . And tech website DigiTimes recently reported that Apple is considering forming a partnership with Rivian.
Such an alliance would certainly make sense for Apple. Obviously, the software behemoth is interested in selling products via EVs. And Rivian is one of the top American EV -oriented firms.
Meanwhile, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe did not deny that the automaker could partner with Apple. He even noted that his company has a history of partnerships. Given these points, I think there’s a very high chance of the two firms forming an alliance. Such a deal should prove to be very lucrative for Rivian.
VinFast (VFS)
Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com
VinFast (NASDAQ: VFS ) is a Vietnam-based EV startup that’s growing very rapidly and has a semi-secret weapon. Last quarter the company’s sales soared 270% YOY to $302.65 million. Meanwhile, its EV deliveries jumped 444% YOY to 9,689.
The automaker’s semi-secret weapon is its alliance with Israeli EV battery maker StoreDot . The company’s batteries will be utilized by VinFast’s commercially available vehicles starting next year.
Another EV maker, Polestar (NASDAQ: PSNY ), recently reported that a test they conducted showed that StorDot’s battery can add 200 miles worth of charge in just 10 minutes.

2024-05-09,3 Promising Robotaxi Stocks to Snap Up Before August 8,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
When Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) announced its August 8 robotaxi event, enthusiasm for autonomous driving got a shot in the arm. Indeed, Tesla stock also received a much-needed jolt as it looked to reverse gears after a nasty drawdown.
Earlier this year, excitement and hope in full-self-driving ( FSD ) technology and the concept of robotaxis faded a bit. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) reportedly pulled the plug on its Apple Car (or Project Titan) program. However, Tesla’s August 8 event may very well bring to hype back. In any case, it will be very interesting to see if what Tesla unveils will help propel the robotaxi and autonomous driving trends back into the driver’s seat again.
Only time will tell what the big day will have in store for TSLA stock and self-driving plays as a whole. Regardless, I believe they’re worth watching (and perhaps buying) as they drive into August.
Tesla (TSLA)
Source: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com
It’s been an awful year for Tesla so far, with shares down 30% year-to-date. For now, not everybody is euphoric about Tesla. It has grappled with rough industry headwinds. Furthermore, considerable negative momentum weighing down its stock.
For the first quarter of 2024, deliveries were down 8.5% as electric vehicle ( EV ) demand took a breather. There doesn’t appear to be any signs of a swift reversal ahead for Tesla or the EV industry. However, investors could begin to be more forgiving of further weak quarterly results. They may hope that August 8 will unleash something truly game-changing for the robotaxi industry.
Also, the Robotaxi event will lay out a roadmap, perhaps a multi-year one, for the gradual release of its robotaxi. And, the degree of autonomy seems unlikely to be here yet. If Musk delivers more clarity and specifics on Tesla’s longer-term robotaxi plans, the firm may beckon longer-term investors to scoop up TSLA stock on weakness.
Baidu (BIDU)
Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ) is a Chinese internet juggernaut that has not been going anywhere fast. The stock is still down over 67% from its February 2021 peak. And, seems to be sinking again after a brief rebound in the back half of 2022.
With its latest agreement to provide mapping data to Tesla to help aid its FSD tech in China, BIDU is a must-watch stock. In fact, the deal stands out as a potentially huge win for both companies as they seek to collaborate. Many may underestimate the potential for a Tesla-Baidu partnership.
Tesla aside, Baidu has been working on its own autonomous driving tech for many years. Leveraging its AI expertise with its Apollo self-driving program, Baidu is a standout way to play the future of the robotaxi and FSD scene.
At 14.3 times trailing price-to-earnings ( P/E ), Baidu stands out as a potentially glorious bargain for investors willing to venture into the hard-hit Chinese market. The company is innovating on many fronts, from generative AI to self-driving.
Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)
Robotaxi and FSD projects represent just a small piece of the pie for Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ). It seeks to defend its Google search platform from potential AI disruptors while also betting big on AI itself. With its large language model ( LLM ) of Google Gemini and its stake in private AI firm Anthropic, Alphabet is a top-two AI stock to own for the long run.
Self-driving capabilities and AI go hand-in-hand. Its Waymo division is testing the roads (without a driver) in certain areas. So, it certainly seems like the emerging robotaxi market is Alphabet’s for the taking. And yet, Waymo isn’t quite perfect yet. A notable February accident could set a nationwide rollout back by quite a bit. In any case, I do not doubt Waymo will improve by leaps and bounds over time.
As a top rival of Tesla’s robotaxi, it will be interesting to see if Alphabet has anything in store for Waymo.

2024-05-09,The 3 Most Undervalued Under-$20 Stocks to Buy in May 2024,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Since the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 have gained 6% and 10% year-to-date, now is the time to buy undervalued stocks under $20.
Investors are anticipating three rate cuts from a now dovish Federal Reserve, and even though GDP growth slowed down in Q1 , corporate profits are strong, which is often a good sign of how healthy the market is.
Investors are happy because the economy is neither too hot (which may produce inflation and an overheated economy) nor too cold (which could bring a recession)— a Goldilocks state . This equilibrium boosts stock prices; Goldman Sachs predicts the S&P 500 will rise 6% to 4,700 in 2024.
In the middle of this, we will explore three undervalued stocks under $20, all with more than 50% upside.
The first competitor, a former mobile phone service giant, is making a strong return by shifting its focus to 5G technology. The second pick works in quantum computing, a niche area expected to expand by 33% in five years. The final stock is a key oil transportation provider, profiting from increased worldwide shipping costs.
Nokia (NOK)
Source: OleksSH / Shutterstock.com
Former mobile phone giant Nokia (NYSE: NOK ) is a 5G contender, with a potential 60% upside from a $6 average price target versus the last close of $3.74.
Nokia plans to achieve a 13% operating margin by 2026 in its new company strategy and business goals. To streamline operations and focus on 5G, safety, and SaaS, Nokia will sell Lumine Group its Device Management and Service Management Platform businesses to improve efficiency for $203.1 million.
Nokia’s portfolio management is shown by its sale of VitalQIP technology to Cygna Labs Corp. and the adoption of Red Hat as its network app infrastructure. Nokia is also changing how Mobile Networks work to expand its business into O-RAN, Cloud RAN, and the military.
Patents are very important to Nokia because they protect its new ideas and keep the company ahead of the competition in the tech industry. On that note, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Samsung now have long-term technology license deals with Nokia, covering cars, media players, and consumer gadgets.
Regarding recent milestones, Nokia finished the first Cloud RAN test with In-Line acceleration for MEA, which improved mobile network technology. Additionally, Nokia and Zayo set a record for North America’s longest live network transfer distance at 800Gb/s.
Finally, Nokia is developing new products and revamping models, such as the Nokia 2660 Flip, which has new colors. It also hints at a 5G version for India, perhaps the Nokia G42 5G.
IonQ (IONQ)
Source: Amin Van / Shutterstock.com
Quantum computing play IonQ (NYSE: IONQ ) is not profitable as of yet. However, considering the allure of quantum computing, a market expected to grow at 33% between 2024 and 2029, the market opportunity is tremendous, reflected by its “Strong Buy,” rating and 86% upside potential.
But the proof is in the pudding: IonQ reached 35 algorithmic qubits on its IonQ Forte platform, one year ahead of schedule, a major engineering milestone.
IonQ also took a big step toward building future quantum networks by adding to its technology skills. It’s working on adding optical interconnects to allow processing across quantum networks, which is very different from traditional setups, where work is split up among many separate cores and processors.
IonQ also revealed that the first specialized quantum computing production plant will open in the U.S. in Bothell, Washington. This is a big step toward making quantum computing available to the public.
Additionally, IonQ’s systems are now available on almost all major cloud platforms, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, and can accessed directly through APIs.
DHT Holdings (DHT)
Source: Shutterstock
DHT Holdings (NYSE: DHT ) completes our list of undervalued stocks under $20, a large oil tanker firm potentially benefitting from global shipping price improvements.
Wall Street analysts rate DHT a “moderate buy,” with an average price goal of $19, implying 63% upside.
DHT Holdings predicted $50,900 per day from time charters in Q1 2024 in April. Its spot market and time charter VLCCs make $54,000 and $39,500 daily, respectively. Despite being lower than the spot market, the time charter rate provides steady income, but spot market charters illustrate strong demand.
Along with the $54,200 discharge-to-discharge rate, 42% of second-quarter 2024 spot days are booked. Spot and time-charter days—54% of possible earnings—are at $46,900 per day.
Geopolitical energy and transportation events benefit DHT Holdings. The oil produced worldwide could go down by 500,000 to 2 million barrels per day in a “small disruption” scenario, increasing DHT Holdings’ oil tanker demand.
Middle Eastern conflict has increased “ton-miles” (cargo volume and distance) by raising crude oil prices and road length. Very large crude carriers, or VLCCs, allow DHT’s tanker fleet to transport large amounts over long hauls during geopolitical tensions, boosting profits.
DHT Holdings will build four VLCCs in South Korea from April to December 2026, helping leverage increased demand and charter prices.

2024-05-09,The 3 Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in May 2024,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
On May 4, value investing disciples trooped to Omaha, Nebraska, for Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE: BRK-A , NYSE: BRK-B ) annual general meeting. Everyone was eager to hear what Warren Buffett had to say about the economy and Berkshire’s operations. The company’s vaunted equity portfolio is a north star for many value investors seeking the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy.
Investors always want to follow Buffett, one of the greatest value investors of our time. The Oracle of Omaha sticks to value investing principles, purchasing high-quality businesses for a reasonable price.
Due to his strict selection criteria, the portfolio comprises some of the best wide-moat businesses. Even better, Buffett states his holding period is forever. So, his picks are businesses with durable competitive advantages that can compound earnings over decades. Looking at the current portfolio, here are some of the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is the largest holding in Berkshire’s equity portfolio, accounting for nearly 40% of holdings. That’s why the markets took note when Berkshire disclosed it trimmed its stake by 13% . However, Buffett quelled any fears about AAPL stock, saying it would continue to be Berkshire’s largest holding.
The iPhone maker suffered mixed fortunes in recent quarters. Although the company’s Services segment has been growing, product revenues are on the decline. As a result, total revenues declined in five of the last six quarters.
That said, the market is forward-looking. That is why the stock rallied over 6% on May 3 after Apple posted its results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Despite the revenue decline of 4.3% from a year ago, the market took positives from management commentary that iPhone revenues could begin growing again. Particularly encouraging was the rebound in China; CEO Tim Cook stated that he was very optimistic about the Chinese market in the long term .
However, artificial intelligence is the main catalyst that makes Apple one of the best Buffett stocks to buy. Management teased its AI rollout and investors are predicting a huge announcement at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June. For now, Apple is still a cash-generating machine and a $110 billion stock buyback will provide a floor on the stock.
Berkshire owns 789.6 million shares of AAPL stock, with its overall stake valued at $143.9 billion.
Coca-Cola (KO)
Source: MAHATHIR MOHD YASIN / Shutterstock.com
In terms of returns, Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ) has been one of the best investments Buffett has made. The soft drink giant retained its moat and earned impressive returns on equity since Buffett started buying in 1988. Still, it’s among the best Buffett stocks to buy. Berkshire currently holds 400 million shares of KO stock, a stake valued at $25.1 billion and 7% of Berkshire’s total portfolio.
Scanning the equity landscape, few companies have the brand strength of Coca-Cola. It sells 1.9 billion servings each day of its popular drinks in more than 200 countries. It is the most valuable soft drink brand , giving it immense pricing power. Additionally, its global scale provides a significant cost advantage against competition.
Indeed, Q1 2024 results proved that Coca-Cola’s brand strength remains intact. The results showed that it increased prices by 13% but still grew unit case volumes by 1%. This highlights that it can raise prices without pushback from consumers.
Due to its significant profitability, Coca-Cola is also a Dividend Aristocrat —an S&P 500 company that increased its dividend for 25 consecutive years. KO recorded 61 consecutive years of dividend growth, making it one of the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy for dividends.
As of this writing, KO stock trades for 21 times forward earnings. Quench your portfolio thirst and earn a 3.1% dividend yield.
American Express (AXP)
Source: Shutterstock
As one of the oldest portfolio holdings, American Express (NYSE: AXP ) deserves a mention due to its durability. The credit card company has been a mainstay in Buffett’s portfolio since the 1960s. Over the years, the business grew tremendously due to the shift from cards to cash.
The move to cards is still ongoing and that’s why AXP stock is one of the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy. According to recent results, the company isn’t resting on its laurels and is executing flawlessly. On April 19, it reported first-quarter revenues increased by 11% from a year ago to $15.8 billion. What’s more, diluted EPS increased from $2.40 to $3.33, an increase of 39%.
Management noted that it saw a high engagement level among premium customers. It expects the earnings momentum to continue as the company adds more members and spending increases in their high credit-quality cohort. In line with this view, they issued 2024 guidance of 9% to 11% revenue growth and EPS of $12.65 to $13.15.
The guidance means that AXP is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 18 times. Over the long term, the bet on millennials and Gen Z presents a significant growth runway. Furthermore, with only a 6% market share in its top five international markets, there is plenty of expansion upside.
Berkshire owns 151.6 million shares of AXP stock, or just more than 20% of the company’s total shares. The stake is valued at $37.5 billion and makes up nearly 10% of Berkshire’s total portfolio.

2024-05-09,"Dividend Harvesting Portfolio Week 166: $16,600 Allocated, $1,490.16 In Projected Dividends","Amazon and Apple reported earnings, while the Fed Chair stated that a rate cut is likely unless there are significant changes.
The market interpreted a softer non-farm payroll report as a sign of a slowing economy, potentially leading to a rate cut.
The Dividend Harvesting Portfolio increased in value and generated a record amount of weekly dividend income.
This was an interesting week as Amazon ( AMZN ) and Apple ( AAPL ) were the latest big tech companies to report earnings, rates remained unchanged at the FOMC meeting , Fed Chair Powell delivered a dovish press conference , and the labor report came in softer than expected. The Fed hasn't pivoted yet, as Chair Powell stated that the Fed needs to see more data that inflation isn't going to continue upward before they start the cutting process. What Fed Chair Powell said gave the market some clarity: a move higher in rates would be unlikely, and the next move the Fed would make would be a cut unless something drastically changes. After a softer non-farm payroll report where the U.S. added 175,000 jobs when the consensus number was 243,000, it looks like the market is interpreting that this could mean the economy is slowing and that the Fed will look at this data favorably. The S&P 500 was falling into the Fed meeting as it stated the week at 5,119.85 and reached 5,014.74 prior to the FOMC meeting, but finished the week up 0.15% as it closed at 5,127.79.

2024-05-09,Berkshire Hathaway's Apple Stake Reduction: Likely A Macro Decision,"Berkshire Hathaway's decision to reduce its stake in Apple, while seemingly being painted as a tax-driven decision, might have hidden nuances.
Macroeconomic data from the Federal Reserve indicate rising financial stress on ordinary Americans, while perceptions shift around the likelihood of a hard landing.
If a recession is imminent, Berkshire Hathaway's massive cash position enables it to shift focus onto recession favorites such as financials and energy - sectors it's already strong in.
On the 4th of May, asset management firm Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRK.A and BRK.B ) announced in the course of its first quarter earnings release that its biggest bet - Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) - was worth $135.4 billion, implying that the former held around 790 million shares of the latter. This meant that the ""Oracle of Omaha"" (as Berkshire Hathaway principal Warren Buffett is often referred to as) has authorized the disposal of around 116 million shares, or 13% of its total stake in Apple.
Most ""Buffettologists"" would recognize that Berkshire Hathaway's investment style isn't known to be tactical; holding ""strong for long"" is the underlying message of their methodology. Apple is certainly one such example and for good reason: unlike fellow ""Magnificent Seven"" constituent Tesla ( TSLA ), Apple has only declined a little under 2% in the Year Till Date (YTD) despite signs of sales slowdown in major market China and signs of stagnation elsewhere. Furthermore, this is the second consecutive quarter wherein the company's Apple bet was cut: in the last quarter, around 1% of its held stake was disposed of....",12

Apple focuses on innovation and cost-cutting, exemplified by Apple Silicon CPUs. Net income and operating income have been growing faster than revenue.
Smartphone and consumer electronics markets show steady growth, along with potential in accessories and cloud gaming.
Near-term catalyst is device replacement cycles. Despite risks like geopolitical tensions, undervaluation and strong services growth justify a ""strong-buy"" rating.

In my previous article on Apple Inc. ( AAPL ), I re-evaluated Apple following its Q1 2024 earnings (which were released on February 1, 2024). The fair price estimate in that article was $276.29, and the future price estimate was $403.14. This prompted an upgrade from ""buy"" to ""strong buy"".
The company released Q2 2024 earnings on May 2 . The company beat EPS and revenue estimates by a slim margin of 0.02% and 2.09% respectively. The company also increased the dividend to $0.25 per share (which is a 4% increase), as well as announced a $110B stock buyback program....",13
2024-05-08,Buffett's Banking Bets: Analyzing the 3 Largest Bank Stocks in Berkshire's Portfolio,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Even before last year’s regional banking crisis, Warren Buffett was bailing on bank stocks . Gone from the portfolio were long-time holdings like Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ), U.S. Bank (NYSE: USB ) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ).
He became disenchanted with the financial institutions and how they operated. He thought they were taking “dumb” risks and were misleading investors by using deceptive accounting tricks to pad their bottom lines. After seeing some red flags in their financial statements, Buffett dumped their shares from Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A )(NYSE: BRK-B ).
The subsequent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank seemed to prove just what Buffett was saying.
And yet Buffett didn’t sell all of his bank stocks. In fact, he owns six bank stocks, a few acquired after he dumped many of the old line banks. For example, Nu Holdings (NASDAQ: NU ), a new-fangled, all-digital Brazilian banking outfit, was bought in 2021. Recently he acquired stock in five Japanese banks , businesses he says he believes their United States counterparts could learn a lot from.
Below are three Warren Buffett bank stocks that comprise the largest holdings in Berkshire Hathaway.
Buffet’s Bank Stocks: Citigroup (C)

Citigroup (NYSE: C ) is performing more like an artificial intelligence stock than a bank stock. Shares of the financial firm are up 63% from the lows hit last October and are running 21% higher in 2024. That vindicates the support Buffett has provided the bank, which assumes almost 1% in his portfolio.
The bank is undergoing a turnaround that is supercharging the stock. It reported first-quarter results last month that were better than Wall street expected. Revenue rose 1% from last year to $21.1 billion, better than analyst expectations of $20.4 billion. Although profits dropped 28% to $1.58 per share, they were much better than the consensus outlook of $1.20 per share. But Citi has now completed its overhaul that sought to significantly reduce costs, in part by effecting dramatic job cuts. It is also selling off over a dozen retail banking businesses.
Banking was Citi’s top-performing segment in the quarter as revenue jumped 49% on the surprising strength of investment banking and corporate lending. The bank’s return on tangible common equity improved dramatically to 9.9% from 1% last year and a negative 6.6% in the fourth quarter.
Buffett owns 55.2 million shares of Citigroup, or 2.9% of the bank’s outstanding shares.
American Express (AXP)
Source: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com
Thought of as mostly as credit card company, American Express (NYSE: AXP ) also offers savings accounts and certificates of deposit online. It also has an online bank called American Express National Bank with savings and checking accounts.
American Express is one of Buffett’s oldest holdings, first acquired back in 1991. Remarkably, he has not bought a single share of AmEx since the late 1990s but time and the effects of compounding allowed it to become the fourth biggest position in Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio. Buffett owns 151.6 million shares of the financial company or 21.1% of the total outstanding shares. With the stake valued at $35.4 billion, American Express occupies nearly 10% of the portfolio’s total.
AmEx also reported better-than-expected results with net interest income (NII), or the amount of money it earns from customers who keep a balance on their accounts, jumping 26% from last year. Not everyone fears the higher interest rates the Federal Reserve is charging. But by also targeting a younger demographic , American Express is enjoying significant growth. Chairman and CEO Stephen Squeri said  millennials and Gen Z consumers “accounted for over 60 percent of new consumer account acquisitions globally.”
Bank of America (BAC)
Source: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.com
The premiere Warren Buffett bank stock is Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ). It was also one of the bank stocks he was buying as the regional banking crisis shook faith in the country’s financial foundations. It took his holdings to over 1 billion shares , or 13.2% of the outstanding total.
At today’s prices, that stake is valued it at $38.8 billion, only surpassed by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) at $144 billion. As it is, the bank represents 10.7% of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio.
The financial giant, one of the biggest banks in the country, has also benefited from high interest rates boosting NII. While it also increased unrealized losses , Bank of America should be able to outlast the storm until those assets come to maturity. The stock market appreciates the stability the bank offers as shares have shot 50% higher from their lows and stand 12% above where they started 2024.
There is no indication Buffett plans to pare his stake in Bank of America as he has been doing with Apple and it will remain a stalwart of Berkshire Hathaway.

2024-05-08,3 Tech Stock Darlings to Scoop Up After Q2 earnings,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Over the past year, advancements in artificial intelligence ( AI ), cloud computing and cybersecurity propelled the tech sector to new Wall Street heights. As a result, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index has returned over 35% in the past 12 months. Now that we are well into the second-quarter earnings season, investors are looking for tech stocks to buy after earnings.
Despite the decline in the tech sector in April, many positive earnings surprises across sectors have led to renewed optimism on Wall Street. And, the “Magnificent Seven” stocks, namely Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) (NASDAQ: GOOG ), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ), are once again on investors’ radars.
Analysts have also been endorsing a number of tech darlings, especially citing AI’s role in the sector’s growth. For instance, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) recently raised Apple’s target price post-earnings , noting the quarterly performance, stock buyback and hints at AI updates to come. With that in mind, let’s explore three tech stocks to to buy after earnings.
Amazon (AMZN)
Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com
The first company is Amazon, which reported impressive Q1 2024 financials on April 30. Revenues surged 13% year-over-year ( YOY ) to $143 billion, driven by strong e-commerce and Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) performance. Net income tripled to $10.4 billion, or 98 cents per diluted share, compared to the same period last year. Additionally, the company’s free cash flow surged to $50 billion. This is a notable improvement from the $3.3 billion outflow in the previous year.
Apart from a strong retail business fueled by robust consumer demand, Amazon’s strategic emphasis on AI infrastructure positions it for further growth. Innovations such as the Trainium and Inferentia chips optimize machine learning tasks, ensuring efficiency. Furthermore, the AI services platform, Bedrock, streamlines deployment and customization . And, third-party applications utilizing Amazon’s infrastructure expand its market presence and reach.
As a result, AMZN stock has gained 22% year-to-date ( YTD ). Meanwhile, the shares are changing hands at 41 times forward earnings and three times trailing sales. Despite the relatively high valuation, analysts foresee further upside. They set a 12-month price target of $220, suggesting an 18% potential increase from current levels. Interested investors may consider the $180 level as a better entry point into Amazon shares.
iShares U.S. Technology ETF (IYW)

Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices , noted that the information technology and communication services sectors, which comprise the majority of the tech industry, drove over 70% of the S&P 500 ’s total return of 26.3% in 2023. The “Magnificent Seven” played a significant role in this rally, contributing around 60% of the index’s total return.
Therefore, the iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSEARCA: IYW ) stands out as a compelling choice . This ETF provides a gateway to a diverse group of U.S. tech companies, reflecting a blend of established players and innovative disruptors.
Since its inception in May 2000, IYW has demonstrated remarkable growth, now boasting net assets totaling $16 billion. The fund offers a comprehensive portfolio comprising 131 holdings, with the top ten commanding approximately 65% of the allocation.
Among its leading holdings are tech giants Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Alphabet. The fund maintains a diversified spread across sectors, including Software & Services (40%), Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment (30%), Tech Hardware & Equipment (18%) and Media & Entertainment (10%).
IYW is up nearly 8% YTD and has gained almost 44% over the past 12 months, outperforming the broad S&P 500 index as well as the Nasdaq 100 index. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios stand at around 36.5x and 9.5x, respectively. Finally, investors should note IYW’s expense ratio of 0.4%.
Qualcomm (QCOM)
Source: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com
Our final pick among top tech stocks to buy earnings is Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ). The leading global provider of semiconductor solutions and wireless technology operates through Qualcomm CDMA Technologies ( QCT ) and Qualcomm Technology Licensing ( QTL ). QCT generates revenue from chipsets for the telecommunications industry, while QTL manages patent licensing.
Recently, QCOM stock hit an all-time high after releasing impressive second-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings. The company reported $9.4 billion in non-GAAP revenues, a 1% increase from the previous year’s quarter, and $2.44 in diluted earnings per share, a 13% rise YOY that exceeded guidance. Notably, QCT Automotive saw exceptional growth, with a 35% surge in revenues due to expanded content in new vehicle launches featuring Snapdragon Digital Chassis products.
Investors have been following the anticipated demand for AI-equipped premium smartphones. Going forward, the company’s strategic diversification into emerging sectors like automotive, IoT and networking underscores Qualcomm’s commitment to long-term sustainability and revenue diversification.
So far in 2024, QCOM shares have returned 24%, and currently trade at around 19 times forward earnings and six times trailing sales, indicating a relatively premium valuation. Nonetheless, analysts’ price targets of $185 still imply an average upside potential of 3% from current levels. Finally, the stock also offers a 1.9% dividend yield.

2024-05-08,PayPal Stock Analysis: Why PYPL Is Still a Huge Bargain Right Now,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
In a column about PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL ) published on Oct. 19, 2023, I wrote that “PYPL stock trades at bargain-basement levels and has a new, up-and-coming CEO. Additionally, I believe the Street is overly worried about threats to PayPal’s dominance.” And I advised investors to “buy the shares on weakness.”
That turned out to be pretty good advice as shares jumped 20% between Oct. 19 and May 6. Also noteworthy is that, during the same period, the shares of SoFi (NASDAQ: SOFI ), a popular fintech name that I’ve been bearish on, fell 6%. And now, after PayPal reported standout first-quarter results and with its shares still trading at very low valuations, I continue to recommend that growth-at-a-reasonable-price investors buy the shares. Also importantly, the company has multiple, potential and strong positive catalysts.
PayPal’s Strong Q1 Results
The fintech giant’s top line advanced 9.4% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier to $7.7 billion while its total payment volume (TPV) jumped an impressive 14% year-over-year ( YOY ) to $404 billion and its earnings per share rose 27% YOY to $1.08.
The company’s continued strong revenue and TPV growth show that the Street’s worries about the firm losing market share to Apple ‘s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Apple Pay are completely unfounded. And the large increase in its EPS suggests that the cost controls implemented by the firm’s new CEO Alex Chriss are bearing fruit.
Low Valuation + Positive Catalysts = Buy
Despite the recent, strong gains of PayPal stock, the name’s valuation continues to be exceptionally low and attractive.
Indeed, the shares have a forward price-earnings ratio of 15.3x and an enterprise value/EBITDA ratio of 9.2 times. Given PayPal’s rapid revenue growth and the large increase in its profits, I believe that the stock remains extremely undervalued.
On the catalyst front, the firm is testing a new, fast checkout feature. According to Chriss, almost 80% of the consumers who have used the feature in tests utilize PayPal to pay when they check out again. Moreover, the conversion rates of the merchants who use it rise about 10%, the CEO reported.
Given these points, I believe that this offering will significantly increase PayPal’s payment volumes while enabling it to convince more vendors to utilize its platform.
Chriss also indicated that the firm is working harder than under his predecessor to market its fraud-prevention solution. Finally, PayPal has been convincing more small and medium businesses to use its Complete Payments suite. The CEO indicated that the companies that utilize this offering use more of PayPal’s products.
Finally, Chriss suggested that he would meaningfully increase the company’s low prices going forward.
Over the longer term, I expect these initiatives, taken together, to enable the growth of PayPal’s top and bottom lines to meaningfully accelerate.
Plenty of runway for growth
There are other indications besides the low valuation of the shares which suggest that the name can advance a great deal.
First,the average price target of Street analysts on the stock is $71.48, meaningfully above its current price of around $65. Second, out of 35 analysts who cover the name, only 15 of them have “buy” ratings on the shares. As more of these analysts “see the light” and upgrade the shares, they are likely to rise meaningfully.
Finally, the shares have a low Relative Strength rating of 48 and an average Accumulation/Distribution rating of C, according to Investor’s Business Daily . These metrics indicate that the stock has underperformed in the last year, while institutions have not bought a great deal of its in the last 13 weeks. As many more investors realize that PayPal stock is a bargain ,the shares should rally a great deal.

2024-05-08,Which Credit Bureau Stock Should You Buy for the Long-Term?,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
When you write about the markets as much as I do, finding subjects to cover is challenging. A recent New York Times article about “Pay Later” lenders gave me an idea about credit bureau stocks to buy.
The Times article discussed how credit bureaus want to start including “buy now, pay later” purchases on consumer credit reports and credit scores.
This was prompted by Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) February move to start reporting loans made through its Apple Pay Later service to Experian (OTCMKTS: EXPGY ), one of the three main credit bureaus.
A major issue with not reporting the loans is that it creates what experts call “phantom debt.” The credit bureaus argue that by including them, consumers are building credit. Pay-later lenders argue that each purchase makes a separate loan, hurting a consumer’s credit score.
Ultimately, the Times article concluded that pay-later firms will either be forced by regulators to report pay-later loans or market forces, such as loan delinquencies, will get them to act.
Either way, the three credit bureaus —Experian, TransUnion (NYSE: TRU ), and Equifax (NYSE: EFX )—should remain integral to the lending industry.
One’s a Buy, one’s a Hold, and one’s a Sell.
Experian (EXPGY)
Source: ©iStock.com/ebstock
Seventeen analysts cover Experian. Of those, 14 rate it a Buy, with a $44.94 target price, about 9% higher than its current share price. Of the three stocks, Experian has the highest approval rating from analysts.
Experian’s investor relations website cites five reasons why you should invest in the company: 1) It’s a market leader, 2) it has a purpose-driven growth strategy, 3) it has a sustainable focus and strong commitment to ESG, 4) it is financially sound, and 5) it has a rock-solid foundation for growth.
That’s corporate speak, for it’s one heck of a company.
In its latest presentation, the company points out that its 2023 revenue of $6.62 billion was higher than Equifax ($5.12 billion) and TransUnion ($3.71 billion). Further, it has the most globally diverse revenue, with 33% outside North America compared to 22% and 20% for the other two, respectively.
The company estimates its global addressable market opportunity is $150 billion annually. That’s a double-edged sword. On the one hand, there’s tremendous growth potential. On the other hand, it’s not going to be easy or cheap to grab a bigger piece of the pie.
When in doubt, I look to free cash flow to decide if a company has what it takes for the long haul. In 2023, it was $1.11 billion , down from $1.31 billion a year earlier. Based on an enterprise value of $41.34 billion , it has a free cash flow yield of 2.7%. Anything under 4% is overvalued.
Experian is a Buy.

TransUnion is covered by 20 analysts . Of those, 16 rate it a Buy, with a $90.00 target price, about 14% higher than its current share price.
As I wrote in the previous section, TransUnion has the lowest annual revenue of the three credit bureaus. However, it’s nearly doubled since hitting a 52-week low of $42.09 in November 2023. Here’s why.
In Q1 2024, TransUnion delivered $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time in its history, up 8%, excluding currency, to $1.02 billion. Every region experienced a year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, its adjusted net income for the quarter was $179 million, 16% higher than Q1 2023.
“We are raising our 2024 guidance following first quarter outperformance and now expect to deliver 5 to 6.5 percent revenue growth for the year. We remain focused on driving strong results in a low-growth market environment, with no assumed in-year benefits from interest rate cuts,” stated CEO Chris Cartwright in its Q1 2024 press release.
In 2023, TransUnion’s free cash flow was $334.70 million . Based on an enterprise value of $20.08 billion , it has a free cash flow yield of 1.7%. Anything under 4% is overvalued.
TransUnion is a Hold.

Equifax is covered by 23 analysts . Of those, 18 rate it a Buy, with a $267.30 target price, about 16% higher than its current share price.
Over the past year, Equifax stock has increased 15%, less than TransUnion, which has increased 21%, or Experian, which has increased 21.5%. That’s the bad news. The good news is that Equifax has significantly outperformed its two competitors over the past five years.
Equifax was founded in Atlanta in 1899 as Retail Credit Company . It changed its name to Equifax in 1975 .
Equifax reported its Q1 2024 results in mid-April. Revenues, excluding currency, increased by 8% to $1.39 billion, while its net income rose 11% to $124.9 million. For all of 2024, it expects revenue of $5.72 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, 8.5% higher than 2023, with adjusted earnings per share of $7.35, 9.5% higher than a year ago .
In 2023, Equifax’s free cash flow was $515.5 million [operating cash flow of $1.12 billion less $601.3 million in capital expenditures], up considerably from 2023. Based on an enterprise value of $33.64 billion , it has a free cash flow yield of 1.5%. Anything under 4% is overvalued.
Equifax is a Sell.

With iPhone sales declining and Apple facing intense competition, it's fair to consider if it is best to stop viewing Apple as a growth stock and reclassify it as a premium dividend-paying, blue-chip company. Let's find out if that reclassification would make Apple overvalued relative to other opportunities.

2024-05-07,"Forget the ""Magnificent Seven"": 1 TSX Tech Stock to Buy Instead","The ‘Magnificent Seven’ have certainly proven to be quite magnificent over the last few years. These companies include Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG )( NASDAQ:GOOGL ), Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ), Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), Meta ( NASDAQ:META ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) and Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ). In fact, the seven largest stocks by market cap on the S&P 500 were pretty much holding up the index, taking up about 30% of the overall index.
So while it looked like the S&P 500 was doing really well, it really came down to these absolutely enormous companies. And that led many investors to have a few worries. So let’s get into what those worries were, and why there’s another TSX tech stock to consider instead.
Worry flurry
The fear was that with the S&P 500 running higher and higher due to the heavy investment in these seven companies, should the companies drop the market could crash. And while that didn’t exactly happen, there was proof of the hypothesis on the markets.
The ‘Magnificent Seven’ reported their earnings near the beginning of 2024, and each did quite well overall. This led to a surge in the S&P 500, with shares continuing to rise higher and higher between January and the end of March.
However, by the time earnings started to come forward once more, and there was still no drop in interest rates, investors began to fear the positivity would’t continue. This led to a drop in the S&P 500, with investments in major companies like Nvidia stock seeing a massive drop in share price.
Consider sectors
That’s why the historically safe S&P 500 hasn’t been all that safe recently. Until there is more exposure to other companies and areas of the market, I would instead consider diversifying. And that should mean looking at strong sectors that are due to continue rising.
One area is the market of semiconductors . As mentioned, shares of Nvidia stock rose higher as the company not only demonstrated its worth in current earnings, but expects even more in the future.
Yet shares of Nvidia stock are now quite expensive. With that in mind, I would instead look at companies that are involved in the semiconductor process. And Celestica ( TSX:CLS ) is perhaps the best option on the TSX today.
Why Celestica stock?
There are many reasons to consider Celestica stock on the TSX today, especially if you’re looking to invest in semiconductors stocks. Celestica stock operates in the semiconductor industry as a provider of manufacturing services and solutions for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Investing in Celestica can provide diversification within the semiconductor sector, as it offers exposure to semiconductor-related activities beyond semiconductor manufacturing itself.
Furthermore, Celestica offers a range of supply chain services, including design, engineering, manufacturing, and aftermarket services. This diversification of services can mitigate some of the risks associated with pure-play semiconductor companies that may be more exposed to fluctuations in chip demand or pricing.
The company has proven its worth as well, seeing shares surge by 303% in the last year alone! And yet as of writing, shares are below 52-week highs. Therefore, it’s a great time for investors to consider picking up Celestica stock on the TSX today. Especially if they want to get away from the over-exposure of the “Magnificent Seven” stocks.

2024-05-07,New Apple M4 Chip Threatens to Dethrone Nvidia (NVDA) Stock,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
One tech leader is gearing up to challenge Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) as a powerful new rival. Indeed, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) reportedly wants to produce its own chips for artificial intelligence ( AI ) software in data centers. According to The Wall Street Journal , the company has been working on this device — internally codenamed Project ACDC (Apple Chips in Data Center) — for years.
Apple hasn’t officially commented on this server project yet. But it recently reminded investors that it’s taking major steps toward cementing its place in the AI race. Today, the tech firm also announced that its M4 system on a chip (SoC) will power the new iPad Pro. AAPL stock closed the day in the green amid growing enthusiasm for the Silicon Valley darling.
Of course, this is good news for Apple. But if the company’s foray into AI and chips continues, Nvidia may finally have an opponent to seriously threaten its market share.
AAPL Stock in the Age of the M4 Chip
Tech enthusiasts would likely have lined up for the new iPad Pro no matter what. But with the added incentive of a powerful new chip helping usher in a new stage of the AI revolution, interest in this sleek new device will be even higher. With that in mind, it’s easy to see why AAPL stock surged today and NVDA stock dipped, as the threat of a dangerous new competitor may be beginning to loom.
What makes the M4 chip special? Apple provided an in-depth overview of why this innovation matters for both investors and consumers:
“[The] M4 has Apple’s fastest Neural Engine ever, capable of up to 38 trillion operations per second, which is faster than the neural processing unit of any AI PC today. Combined with faster memory bandwidth, along with next-generation machine learning ( ML ) accelerators in the CPU, and a high-performance GPU, M4 makes the new iPad Pro an outrageously powerful device for artificial intelligence.”
This catalyst is likely exactly what Apple needs to bolster to its place as a pillar of Silicon Valley. Despite some recent momentum, AAPL stock remains in the red so far this year and some experts have expressed concern . One analyst at Barclays recently reiterated a “sell” rating on AAPL stock. Still, it’s hard to keep a sector leader down — and Apple has repeatedly proven its resilience and ability to continue innovating.
What Comes Next?
Apple is zeroing in on the next phase of AI technology all while the red-hot artificial intelligence market continues to surge. The company’s new M4 chip could signal a turning point for the tech giant and, as more updates on ACDC are released, AAPL stock may rise even further.
All told, Apple is in an excellent position to secure a piece of this lucrative space.

As the stock market starts to pick up where it left off before running into April turbulence, value investors should be willing to give undervalued Nasdaq stocks a look. Some are cheaper after the latest round of earnings season, which was met with mixed results across the board.
In any case, don’t bet against the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 now that it’s regained most of the ground it has lost in an ugly April. As the bull market commences, the following undervalued Nasdaq stocks are worth adding to the watchlist as tech momentum and Fed jitters ease. At the same time, quarterly earnings take a front-row seat.
The following undervalued Nasdaq stocks are among the timelier bets on the market, even if the latest earnings “bump” causes some investors to depart.
Starbucks (SBUX)
Source: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com
It was really hard to get over just how terrible the latest quarterly earnings results were for Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ). The firm lowered full-year sales and earnings expectations while clocking in a sudden drop in profits. It was not only a bad showing by its new CEO, Laxman Narasimhan, but it seems like the Starbucks growth thesis is broken as we know it.
Legendary Starbucks founder and ex-top boss Howard Schultz recently commented on the matter, noting that its locations need a “maniacal focus on the customer experience,” Indeed, it appears Narasimhan has been doing his best to improve things at the store level (he’s taken shifts at Starbucks), but to no avail.
You can’t fault Starbucks entirely for the rough patch, though. The broader quick-serve restaurant scene has been rocked lately, with consumers responding to widespread price increases by putting away their wallets. Starbucks has just felt the industry hit a bit harder.
I think Schultz, a notable “boomerang CEO,” may need to make another return to the helm if Starbucks’ latest crisis worsens. The stock has now shed around 42% of its value from its 2021 highs. That’s some serious underperformance that perhaps only Schultz may know how to solve. Either way, the stock looks super cheap right here.
Adobe (ADBE)
Source: Tattoboo / Shutterstock
Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) seems to be in an enviable position to monetize emerging generative artificial intelligence ( AI ) technologies as it brings its creative suite user base to this new era. That said, the stock hasn’t been booming of late compared to most other companies looking to tap into AI to jolt sales growth. The stock is down 15% year to date, while most other AI stocks have been gaining.
Indeed, it’s hard to be enthused about Adobe’s AI capabilities when incredible AI image generators Midjourney and OpenAI’s Dall-E may find themselves nipping at Adobe’s heels over the coming years. Despite this, I view Adobe as a Nasdaq darling and AI underdog that could have plenty of surprises up its sleeves as it continues rolling out new AI innovations.
More recently, the firm made a big splash in the realm of AI video generation and editing . From text-to-video to AI-assisted video editing in Premier Pro, it’s clear Adobe wants a big piece of the AI creative market.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock recently shocked investors with a historic $110 billion buyback announcement. The big buyback news and some better-than-expected quarterly numbers were enough to propel AAPL stock around 7%.
It will be interesting to see where Apple goes from here as it moves on from its two-year period of relative sluggishness. The stock is currently trading at 28.26 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) — not exactly cheap for a firm that’s run into a bit of a growth slump.
AI rumors could certainly pick up traction as we inch closer to the second half. But could we be looking at a buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news situation regarding AI?
As always, only time will tell. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to value Apple shares here, with Warren Buffett recently announcing that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B ) had slashed its stake by 13%.

“The new iPad Pro with M4 is a great example of how building best-in-class custom silicon enables breakthrough products,” said Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Technologies. “The power-efficient performance of M4, along with its new display engine, makes the thin design and game-changing display of iPad Pro possible, while fundamental improvements to the CPU, GPU, Neural Engine, and memory system make M4 extremely well suited for the latest applications leveraging AI. Altogether, this new chip makes iPad Pro the most powerful device of its kind.”
New Technologies Enabling the New iPad Pro
Delivering a giant leap in performance over the previous iPad Pro with M2, M4 consists of 28 billion transistors built using a second-generation 3-nanometer technology that further advances the power efficiency of Apple silicon. M4 also features an entirely new display engine designed with pioneering technologies, enabling the stunning precision, color accuracy, and brightness uniformity of the Ultra Retina XDR display, a state-of-the-art display created by combining the light of two OLED panels.
New 10-core CPU
M4 has a new up-to-10-core CPU consisting of up to four performance cores and now six efficiency cores. The next-generation cores feature improved branch prediction, with wider decode and execution engines for the performance cores, and a deeper execution engine for the efficiency cores. And both types of cores also feature enhanced, next-generation ML accelerators.
M4 delivers up to 1.5x faster CPU performance over the powerful M2 in the previous iPad Pro. 1 Whether working with complex orchestral music files in Logic Pro® or adding highly demanding effects to 4K video in LumaFusion, M4 boosts performance across pro workflows.
GPU Brings New Capabilities to iPad Pro
The new 10-core GPU of M4 builds upon the next-generation graphics architecture of the M3 family of chips. It features Dynamic Caching, an Apple innovation that allocates local memory dynamically in hardware and in real time to dramatically increase the average utilization of the GPU. This significantly increases performance for the most demanding pro apps and games.
Hardware-accelerated ray tracing comes to iPad for the first time, and enables even more realistic shadows and reflections in games and other graphically rich experiences. Hardware-accelerated mesh shading is also built into the GPU, and delivers greater capability and efficiency in geometry processing, enabling more visually complex scenes in games and graphics-intensive apps. Pro rendering performance in apps like Octane gets a huge boost with M4, and is now up to four times faster than on M2. 1 With these improvements to the CPU and GPU, M4 maintains Apple silicon’s industry-leading performance per watt. M4 can deliver the same performance as M2 using just half the power. And compared with the latest PC chip in a thin and light laptop, M4 can deliver the same performance using just a fourth of the power. 2
The Most Powerful Neural Engine Ever
M4 has a blazing-fast Neural Engine — an IP block in the chip dedicated to the acceleration of AI workloads. This is Apple’s most powerful Neural Engine ever, capable of an astounding 38 trillion operations per second — a breathtaking 60x faster than the first Neural Engine in A11 Bionic. Together with next-generation ML accelerators in the CPU, the high-performance GPU, and higher-bandwidth unified memory, the Neural Engine makes M4 an outrageously powerful chip for AI. And with AI features in iPadOS® like Live Captions for real-time audio captions, and Visual Look Up, which identifies objects in video and photos, the new iPad Pro allows users to accomplish amazing AI tasks quickly and on device.
iPad Pro with M4 can easily isolate a subject from its background throughout a 4K video in Final Cut Pro® with just a tap, and can automatically create musical notation in real time in StaffPad by simply listening to someone play the piano. And inference workloads can be done efficiently and privately while minimizing the impact on app memory, app responsiveness, and battery life. The Neural Engine in M4 is Apple’s most capable yet, and is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC today.
Advanced Media Engine for Smooth, Efficient Streaming
The Media Engine of M4 is the most advanced to come to iPad. In addition to supporting the most popular video codecs, like H.264, HEVC, and ProRes®, it brings hardware acceleration for AV1 to iPad for the first time. This provides more power-efficient playback of high-resolution video experiences from streaming services.
Better for the Environment
The power-efficient performance of M4 helps the all-new iPad Pro meet Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency and deliver all-day battery life. This results in less time needing to be plugged in and less energy consumed over its lifetime.
Today, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations, and by 2030, plans to be carbon neutral across the entire manufacturing supply chain and life cycle of every product.
Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, AirPods, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro.

Today, it gets even better with key improvements and the addition of a new virtual Bass Player and Keyboard Player. Session Players augment the live-playing experience while ensuring artists maintain full agency during any phase of their music-making process.
Bass Player was trained in collaboration with today’s best bass players using advanced AI and sampling technologies. Users can choose from eight different Bass Players and guide their performance with controls for complexity and intensity, while leveraging advanced parameters for slides, mutes, dead notes, and pickup hits. Bass Player can jam along with chord progressions, or users can choose from 100 Bass Player loops to draw new inspiration. With Chord Track, users can define and edit the chord progressions to a song, and the virtual Bass Player will follow along perfectly. Plus, with Studio Bass plug-in, users gain access to six new, meticulously recorded instruments, from acoustic to electric — all inspired by the sounds of today’s most popular bass tones and genres.
With Keyboard Player, users can choose from four different styles, designed in cooperation with top studio musicians and made to accompany a wide variety of music genres. Keyboard Player can play everything from simple block chords to chord voicing with extended harmony — with nearly endless variations. Like Bass Player, Chord Track adds and edits the chord progression of the song, so Keyboard Player follows along. Using Studio Piano plug-in, users can select additional sound-shaping options, with the ability to adjust three mic positions, pedal noise, key noise, release samples, and sympathetic resonance.
Stem Splitter: Recover Great Recordings
Most musicians perform their best without the pressure of a formal studio session. These moments are often found in Voice Memos recordings, an old demo cassette tape, or are captured from a live show. Listening back, these recordings can reveal magical performances that are nearly impossible to re-create, making them lost to time. Now, with Stem Splitter, an artist can recover moments of inspiration from any audio file and separate nearly any mixed audio recording into four distinct parts: Drums, Bass, Vocals, and Other instruments, right on the device. 2 With these tracks separated, it’s easy to apply effects, add new parts, or change the mix. Powered by AI and M-series Apple silicon, Stem Splitter is lightning fast.
ChromaGlow: Dial in the Perfect Tone
ChromaGlow models the sounds produced by a blend of the world’s most revered studio hardware by leveraging AI and the power of M-series Apple silicon. 3 Users can dial in the perfect tone with five different saturation styles to add ultrarealistic warmth, presence, and punch to any track. They can also choose from modern clean sounds, nostalgic vintage warmth, or more extreme styles that can be shaped and molded to taste.
Powered by iPad and Mac
Since its introduction last year, Logic Pro for iPad has seen rapid adoption from creatives. Designed from the ground up to take full advantage of touch, Logic Pro transforms iPad into almost any instrument imaginable, and thanks to the portable design of iPad, it becomes a complete studio experience on the go. With the power and performance of Apple silicon, musicians can complete complex multitrack projects, create custom software instrument sounds, leverage a full-featured professional mixer, and explore the app’s vast collection of effects plug-ins.
Working between iPad and Mac is easy with project round-tripping, allowing users to make music while on the go and continue perfecting their project when back in the studio.

The 11-inch model weighs less than a pound, and the 13-inch model is nearly a quarter pound lighter than its predecessor — allowing pro users to extend their workflows in new ways and in more places. The new iPad Pro is available in two gorgeous finishes — silver and space black — both with 100 percent recycled aluminum enclosures.
World’s Most Advanced Display
The new iPad Pro debuts the Ultra Retina XDR, the world’s most advanced display, to provide an even more remarkable visual experience. The Ultra Retina XDR display features state-of-the-art tandem OLED technology that uses two OLED panels and combines the light from both to provide phenomenal full-screen brightness. The new iPad Pro supports an incredible 1000 nits of full-screen brightness for SDR and HDR content, and 1600 nits peak for HDR. No other device of its kind delivers this level of extreme dynamic range. Tandem OLED technology enables sub-millisecond control over the color and luminance of each pixel, taking XDR precision further than ever. Specular highlights in photos and video appear even brighter, and there’s more detail in shadows and low light than ever before on iPad® — all while delivering even more responsiveness to content in motion. For pro users working in high-end, color-managed workflows or challenging lighting conditions, a new nano-texture glass option comes to iPad Pro for the first time. 1 Nano-texture glass is precisely etched at a nanometer scale, maintaining image quality and contrast while scattering ambient light for reduced glare. With its breakthrough tandem OLED technology, extreme brightness, incredibly precise contrast, brilliant colors, and nano-texture glass option, the new Ultra Retina XDR display is the world’s most advanced display, giving iPad Pro customers an unparalleled viewing experience.

A gyroscope allows users to roll Apple Pencil Pro for precise control of the tool they’re using. Rotating the barrel changes the orientation of shaped pen and brush tools, just like pen and paper. And with Apple Pencil hover, users can visualize the exact orientation of a tool before making a mark.
With these advanced features, Apple Pencil Pro allows users to bring their ideas to life in entirely new ways, and developers can also create their own custom interactions. Apple Pencil Pro brings support for Find My® to Apple Pencil for the first time, helping users locate Apple Pencil Pro if misplaced. It pairs, charges, and is stored on the side of iPad Air through a new magnetic interface. iPad Air also supports Apple Pencil (USB-C), ideal for note taking, sketching, annotating, journaling, and more, at a great value.
iPad Air works with the Magic Keyboard®, which includes a floating design, built-in trackpad, and backlit keyboard. The new Smart Folio for iPad Air attaches magnetically and now supports multiple viewing angles for greater flexibility. Available in charcoal gray, light violet, denim, and sage, the new Smart Folio complements the finishes of iPad Air.
Power of iPadOS 17
iPadOS 17 brings new levels of personalization and versatility that elevate the iPad Air experience:
Users can customize the Lock Screen to make it more personal, taking advantage of the 11-inch or new, larger 13-inch display on iPad Air. This includes stunning wallpapers, fun ways to showcase users’ favorite photos, and expressive fonts and colors to personalize the look of the date and time.
Interactive widgets take glanceable information further with the ability to get tasks done right in the moment with just a tap.
Messages offers fun ways for users to express themselves, including a stickers experience with emoji stickers and the ability to create Live Stickers by lifting subjects from photos.
In FaceTime , users can leave an audio or video message when someone doesn’t pick up a call. With Continuity Camera, users can take advantage of the camera and microphone on iPad Air and initiate a video call directly from Apple TV®, or start the call on iPad and then hand it off to Apple TV.
Freeform offers new drawing tools; support for hover, tilt, and snap to shape; the ability to add connection lines and new shapes to any object; and Follow Along to guide collaborators around the board.
The Notes app gives users new ways to organize, read, annotate, and collaborate on PDFs. Working with PDFs is also easier with AutoFill , which intelligently identifies and fills fields in forms.
With Stage Manager® , users can work with multiple overlapping windows in a single view, resize windows, tap to switch between apps, and more.
In addition to Visual Look Up , Subject Lift , and Live Text , users can take advantage of AI capabilities like Live Captions for real-time audio captions and intelligent accessibility features such as Personal Voice .
Vast Ecosystem of Apps
iPad Air also comes with exceptional apps built in, including Freeform, Notes, iMovie®, GarageBand®, Photos, and the iWork® suite of productivity apps — Pages®, Numbers®, and Keynote®. Logic Pro® for iPad 2 and Final Cut Pro for iPad 2 bring new features that transform iPad Air into an even more flexible creative powerhouse. 2 Available Monday, May 13, Logic Pro delivers breakthrough professional experiences for songwriting, beat-making, producing, and mixing with powerful AI-driven features, including Session Players, ChromaGlow™, and Stem Splitter.

And with over a million apps on the App Store®, iPad Air users can find apps for anything they want to do, from advanced productivity to creativity.
Better for the Environment
The new iPad Air is designed with the environment in mind, including 100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure, 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets, and 100 percent recycled gold plating and tin soldering in multiple printed circuit boards. The new iPad Air meets Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency, and is free of mercury, brominated flame retardants, and PVC. The packaging is 100 percent fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal to remove plastic from all packaging by 2025.

2024-05-07,RIVN Stock Alert: Is Rivian About to Partner With Apple?,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Stock in electric vehicle (EV) maker Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN ) rose on rumors it may partner with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ).
Apple recently canceled its plans to build an “Apple Car” but may still be interested in the space, according to trade magazine reports.
RIVN stock rose 9% overnight and is expected to open this morning at about $11 per share, its market capitalization rising to nearly $11 billion. Apple was up 1% overnight and is now worth about $2.8 trillion.
Apple of Its Eye
I recently suggested that Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) should fire CEO Elon Musk and buy Rivian . I know that’s not happening. In the article, I called TSLA a stock to sell.
But the Apple story reflects the impulse leading to my story, Rivian’s growing reputation in EV circles. It is now seen as a company that understands the business and can scale to meet its cost challenges.
Rivian’s R3 announcement turned the industry on its head. The R3 will be a mid-size car at a mid-sized car price when it’s built in 2026 or 2027. Meanwhile, Rivian faces the challenge of selling its $45,000 R2 in quantities sufficient to justify the cost of a new plant in Georgia.
An Apple connection would bring Rivian an improved user interface and entertainment system . It would also give Rivian a second deep-pocketed benefactor alongside Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). They got the company started five years ago with an order for 100,000 electric delivery vans .
A Rivian connection would offer Apple much less risk than building its own car. Success could lead it to purchase Rivian, at least in the minds of some Rivian shareholders.
RIVN Stock: What Happens Next?
It’s possible that nothing happens as a result of all this press coverage. But the story is still intriguing enough to put smiles on the faces of both companies’ shareholders.
As of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had a LONG position in AMZN and AAPL. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines .

2024-05-07,Apple: The Real Reasons Warren Buffett Is Selling,"Warren Buffett's decision to sell Apple shares is likely driven by concerns over short-term profit prioritization, weakening market position, and increasing regulatory and geopolitical risks.
Apple's failure to deliver innovative projects like Project ""Titan"" and increasing competition, particularly from rivals like Xiaomi, should worry investors.
High valuation multiples, stagnant growth, and various risks including regulatory investigations and supply chain dependencies could further justify Buffett's decision to trim Berkshire's Apple stake.
When our long-term competitive position improves as a result of these almost unnoticeable actions, we describe the phenomenon as “widening the moat.” And doing that is essential if we are to have the kind of business we want a decade or two from now. We always, of course, hope to earn more money in the short-term. But when short-term and long-term conflict, widening the moat must take precedence.

2024-05-07,Caution! Why SoundHound AI Stock May Be All Bark and No Bite.,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN ) creates voice artificial intelligence ( AI ) solutions that enables businesses across various sectors to develop AI-driven conversational experiences for their customers. Due to the AI craze that’s caught the market by storm, SOUN shares have more than doubled in 2024, but the party could be over. A short seller report, a lack of profitability and weighty valuation could make things worse for SOUN shareholders. For those looking to invest now, here are 3 reasons to exercise some serious caution.
Short Seller Report: SOUN’s AI product is not unique
Once generative AI came to the mainstream in 2023, the company launched SoundHound Chat AI, which integrates with knowledge domains. It pulls real-time data like weather, sports, stocks, flight status and restaurants create an AI-powered voice assistant experience. Moreover, when Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) revealed it had a stake in the company, AI investors quickly added SOUN shares to their portfolio.
However, a pretty damning report from short seller Capybara Research has underscored why they may have made a mistake. Like all short seller reports, not every single allegation is necessarily 100% true, but many are grounded in thorough research and should be taken seriously. Capybara Research claimed “The Houndify product uses commodity speech recognition to search a manually programmed knowledge graph.” This basically means the algorithms undergirding the Houndify platform are nothing special and could easily be replicated by other companies.
Moreover, the report says SoundHound’s product is not fundamentally different from speech-recognition products already rolled out by tech giants including Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Google.
No real pathway to profitability
SoundHound’s year-over-year revenue growth has already started to stall since the macroeconomic environment became pretty unstable. According to Koyfin, SoundHound delivered solid double-digit revenue growth in 2023 but this was below that of prior years.
As the short seller report highlighted, SoundHound has lost some major customers that the company admitted were crucial to the business. These customers include Mercedes-Benz (OTCMKTS: MBGYY ), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Deutsche Telekom (OTCMKTS: DTEGY ). The loss of top customers coupled with the company’s product not being so unique, could make profitability difficult for SoundHound.
Valuation has become pretty rich
The rally that catapulted U.S. equities to frothier valuations in first quarter ended abruptly in the second quarter. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 posted their worst losses at the end of April with the former falling 2.4% while the latter fell 2.6%. Still, U.S.-listed stocks overall remain expensive and at risk of more volatility as a result.
This gets us to a stock like SoundHound AI. The company has seen its share price more than double since the start of the year. The company is trading at 23x forward sales, which is quite high for a sales multiple. Of course, because the company is not yet profitable, so the EBITDA and price-to-earnings multiples are out of whack already.
Fears of higher for longer interest rates will continue playing a major role in market volatility. That potentially jeopardizes current SOUN shareholders.

2024-05-07,3 Sinking Stocks to Quickly Abandon Now,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
It has been a few volatile weeks for U.S. equities. After ending the first quarter of 2024 with significant gains, the S&P500 and Nasdaq posted some of their worst months in a while in April. These major indices fell 2.63% and 2.42%, respectively. This dip has led to investors reevaluating their portfolios to consider if there are any stocks they will want to sell now.
Macroeconomic environment and the structural conditions within the market continue to make certain stocks untenable investments in the near and medium-terms. For one, trading multiples of U.S. equities in general are still pretty frothy. The macroeconomic data in coming weeks could still point to higher-than-expected inflation, placing bets on near-term Federal Reserve rate cuts further in doubt. Moreover, the U.S economy appears to be slowing based on recent Q1 data.
With that said, below are three sinking stocks to sell now as the market remains volatile.
SentinelOne (S)

The cybersecurity space has been some of the most afflicted in terms of broader macroeconomic machinations. While many enterprises have moved a lot of data and services to the cloud, these same businesses have, in turn, demanded a holistic approach to cybersecurity. Cybersecurity stocks posted amazing returns in 2020 and 2021 for this very reason. The macroeconomic environment, unfortunately, has made enterprises to think twice about allocating costs to the implementation of new cloud security software.
This is where SentinelOne (NYSE: S ) comes in. The cybersecurity firm’s “Singularity Extended Detection and Response Platform” leverages artificial intelligence to power cybersecurity solutions for an enterprise’s cloud network. Unfortunately, macroeconomic uncertainty has created headwinds for SentinelOne’s top-line growth, which slowed dramatically from triple-digit growth in 2021 and 2022 to mid-double-digit growth in 2023.
SentinelOne’s share price has fallen 16% on a year-to-date basis. Increased competition from dominant cybersecurity player CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD ) could lead to further losses.
Tesla (TSLA)
Source: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com
Recent news of Elon Musk’s trip to China and subsequent tentative approval of the Tesla’s (NASDAQ: TSLA ) autonomous system caused the electric vehicle (EV) maker’s shares to rally 15% on April 29. Ultimately, Tesla will be able to improve operating margins a few percentage points, which is the implication that sparked the rally. However, waning demand in the global EV market still spells trouble for Tesla in the medium and long-term.
Elevated interest rates have created a waning demand environment for new vehicles, combustion engine and electric. First quarter Tesla earnings results missed revenue, gross margin, and profit estimates , underscoring the difficulty of the automotive selling environment.
Tesla shares have fallen 25% on a year-to-date basis. Once investors refocus on the downward spiraling EV market environment, TSLA shares could receive even more pressure. And, solidifying Tesla’s position as one of the stocks investors will want to sell now.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com
iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) recently released its Q2 2024 earnings . And, despite various data points showing Apple’s decline in China, the tech giant remained optimistic on its long-term outlook. This optimism coupled with the largest share buyback program in the company’s history, $110 billion, sent shares soaring.
Let’s first tackle the shareholder buyback point. When a company repurchases shares from shareholders, it’s usually at a premium to the current stock price and investors are satisfied. However, it’s important to note while these buybacks are great for large shareholders, benefits for smaller shareholders are minimal in comparison. In other words, retail investors may get a short-term boost in the value of their investment once a share buyback program is announced, but a lot of the gains are going to go to the big fish.
The market’s positive reaction to Apple’s earnings announcement is also puzzling for other reasons. Apple’s top-line figures still declined 4% on a year-over-year basis with iPhone sales falling 10%. The optimism that Apple’s management announced doesn’t seem grounded in the reality of the data coming out of China these days. As Bloomberg points out in an article , a number of independent industry research do not point to anything optimistic.
Huawei’s continued rise will create additional headwinds for the iPhone maker. It just seems CEO Tim Cook’s optimism should be taken with a grain of salt and nothing more.

2024-05-06,4 most active stocks on Dow Jones after US Fed kept interest rates unchanged,"U.S. Federal Reserve left its benchmark overnight borrowing rate unchanged but kept hopes of rate cuts in the coming months alive on May 1 st ( read more ). Here are the three most active stocks on Dow Jones since the central bank’s announcement.
Chevron Corp (NYSE: CVX)
Chevron has been an active Dow Jones stock since the Fed’s announcement because the energy giant relies on debt financing for capital expenditures.
Plus, it pays a healthy dividend yield of just over 4.0% at writing which will turn all the more attractive for investors once the U.S. central bank begins to cut interest rates.
Lower rates also tend to spur economic activity that typically delivers a boost to oil demand and by extension revenue of an energy giant like Chevron.
$CVX trading volume sits at 8.427 million at writing.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL)
Apple is being actively traded since the Fed’s rate decision this month since it’s a tech behemoth that invests rather aggressively in pursuit of growth.
And the cost of borrowing money to make those investments will cut significantly once the interest rates start to move lower.
$AAPL, however, has been in focus recently also because it reported its financial results for the second quarter on May 2 nd ( find out more ).
Trading volume of Apple Inc is at 76.481 million at writing and the stock is up roughly 7.0% since the start of this month.
Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS)
Disney has been among the most active stocks on Dow Jones after U.S. Fed kept interest rates unchanged last week.
That’s partly because accelerated consumer spending typically follows rate cuts which could be a benefit for the mass media and entertainment conglomerate.
$DIS is scheduled to report its financial results for the second quarter on May 7th. Consensus is for it to earn $1.11 per share versus 93 cents a share last year.
Ahead of the earnings report, Disney stock ended today with trading volume 16.198 million. It’s up close to 30% versus its year-to-date low at writing.

2024-05-06,7 Stocks to Buy to Satisfy Your IRA Limits in 2024,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
2023 tax season has come and gone meaning it is time to consider 2024 contributions to your IRA. That will include some mix of Index and mutual funds, ETFs, bonds, and individual stocks. The maximum contribution in 2024 is $7,000 for those under 50 years of age and $8,000 for those 50 and older.
While most investors will be primarily mixing funds and bonds many will also be picking individual stocks to add to their IRAs. How much money an investor dedicates to individual stocks within an IRA is largely a function of risk tolerance. Generally speaking, the higher that contribution, the more risk and reward it entails.
That said, let’s look at some of the better individual stocks to choose when considering IRA contribution limits in 2024.
Microsoft (MSFT)
Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com
Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) stock is going to be one of the most popular large cap choices in an individual IRA in 2024. Many investors will have exposure to Microsoft through various index funds and ETFs. However, here we’re advocating for purchasing MSFT shares on an individual basis as part of an individual retirement account.
Frankly, investing in Microsoft should be an easy choice. Analysts recommend purchasing Microsoft on a near unanimous basis . It’s generally expected that the value of those shares should rise by between 20% in a base case scenario and by as much as 50% should things rapidly improve.
There’s plenty of reason to believe in that best case scenario when one looks at the firm’s most recent earnings report from April 25 . Revenues grew by 17% and net income increased by 20%. Thus, it’s entirely logical to believe that the value of the stock will rise by 20% moving forward. I like Microsoft because its AI fueled Cloud growth is a particular bright spot. Otherwise, investors should continue to consider Microsoft for its blend of growth and scale that has rarely been rivaled in the past.
Realty Income (O)
Source: Shutterstock
Realty Income (NYSE: O ) represents an excellent individual stock choice within an IRA, especially for income-oriented investors. Each share includes a dividend yielding 5.6% paid as a monthly dividend. The beauty of a monthly dividend is that it includes three times as many distributions meaning greater opportunities to compound gains.
Realty Income is also well-positioned defensively. Although the company is very retail oriented, it is highly recession resistant . The vast majority of its tenants operate in recession resistant sectors. That generally includes grocery stores, dollar stores, drugstores and other retail categories that tend to be non-cyclical in nature.
The other thing to note about Realty Income is the structure of the leases it signs with its tenants. They tend to be longer, usually on the order of 10 years. Further, the triple net agreements place many of the cost responsibilities on the tenants themselves. That leaves more money for investors and shareholders in the end.
Coca-Cola (KO)
Source: BORIMAT PRAOKAEW / Shutterstock.com
Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ) will continue to show up on lists and articles discussing the best stocks to invest in. Whether it’s related to Warren Buffett or defensive positioning and anticipation of a weakening economy, Coca-Cola is generally well regarded.
It’s that ladder notion – a potential economic weakening – that bears discussion.  A lot of the issue centers around the ongoing fight against inflation. The Federal Reserve has not had as much success in the last few months as it would have liked. That leads some to believe that inflation will be much more persistent than initially believed.
I believe Coca-Cola is uniquely positioned to benefit from that ongoing issue. First of all, Coca-Cola is one of the best defensive stocks there is. It tends to weather economic downturns better than the vast majority of the stock market. Further, consumers continue to buy Coca-Cola products despite higher prices brought on by inflation . In fact, the company raised its guidance for 2024 due to that fact. If inflation will indeed continue to prove more sticky than initially believed, Coca-Cola looks uniquely positioned to thrive regardless.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) continues to deal with a period of stagnation and slowing sales. The news there isn’t all bad by any means. while Apple’s sales and earnings did decline on a year-over-year basis, each also bested guidance .
Apple decided to placate investor worries by increasing its share buyback program while simultaneously increasing its dividend by 4%. So, Apple is trying to introduce greater share price stability via more conservative means. The market seems to have appreciated the efforts. However, that is not the only reason to buy Apple at the moment.
The company remains tight-lipped about its AI plans. CEO Tim Cook is likely to divulge the details about Apple’s AI future at the firm’s Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in June.
The best time to have invested in Apple would have been a few days ago before the share buyback announcement. However, all is not lost. Apple’s shares are strengthening again as it appears dedicated to stability. That, along with the potential for a price spike in June suggest that investors should buy in the interim.
Amazon (AMZN)
Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com
It’s difficult not to like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) stock at the moment. Aside from the ever persistent threat of anti-monopoly litigation there’s very little to dislike. Amazon has largely avoided that threat for so long that it’s probably better to just ignore it wholesale. Instead, investors should focus on its earnings report and what it says about the company’s future.
Sales increased by 13%, rising to $143.3 billion. The company’s Cloud service – Amazon Web Services – continues to thrive. As good as those numbers are, the focus is really all about artificial intelligence.
The company announced a generative AI based assistant intended to speed software development. That AI assistant should be particularly powerful from the perspective that it leverages Amazon’s AWS cloud. The company concurrently announced Bedrock , a fully managed AI service for quickly building and launching applications.
Those developments –  along with strong results – suggest that Amazon is an excellent individual stock choice in any IRA.
Nvidia (NVDA)
Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) stock continues to face a bevy of headwinds that have pulled its share prices lower by about 15%. Those headwinds include news that its Blackwell chips might ship later than initially anticipated, disappointing guidance from rival AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ), and ongoing concerns regarding when in 2024, if at all, rate cuts will occur.
Buy it anyway because it is one of the best individual stocks to have in your IRA or otherwise. The simple fact remains that until another firm produces better AI chips than Nvidia does, there’s no reason to doubt the company over the mid and long-term. The artificial intelligence boom continues to be the greatest opportunity for investors of this generation.
Nvidia dominates demand for the chips that power the AI boom. However, Nvidia’s strengths extend beyond chips alone when it comes to AI. The company is rapidly moving into the artificial intelligence fueled humanoid robots sector. The Project GR00T foundational model is going to be an interesting theme to follow. Nvidia has clearly affected the data center space and may ultimately disrupt the entire economy down to the factory floor.
American Express (AXP)
Source: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com
American Express (NYSE: AXP ) is arguably the best choice of the top three credit card stocks. Actually, if you follow the returns it’s inarguable that it’s the best. American Express has outperformed Visa (NYSE: V ) and MasterCard (NYSE: MA ) in 2023. That outperformance spans back more than 5 years and suggests that American Express will continue to outperform its rivals.
That logically begs the question of why American Express has been able to outperform other credit card stocks. My theory is that it relates to credit worthiness. American Express serves a higher income consumer base which is more credit-worthy. The risk of non-payments and defaults is much lower and as a result AXP shares simply outperform.
Frankly speaking, any of the major three credit card stocks are good choices for the purpose of an IRA investment: each is relatively stable and well exposed to fintech growth opportunities. However, for all of the reasons I just discussed, American Express stands head and shoulders above the other two.

2024-05-10,The 3 Best Auto Stocks to Buy in May 2024,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The auto sector is entering an exciting and more lucrative era. That’s because automakers are starting to charge subscription fees for high-tech services. I believe that these companies will soon also start offering to track the well-being of various components within vehicles in exchange for fees. Which may transform them into the one of the best auto stocks investors want to buy. Of course, for the owners of electric vehicles, keeping informed about the welfare and needs of their EV’s batteries is extremely important. As a result, I’m sure that many owners will be willing to pay to stay on top of those matters.
Importantly, most consumers seem willing to pay monthly fees for services within their vehicles. But they often like to try out these services first. In July 2023, S&P polled roughly 4,500 consumers who had a free trial or a subscription for services within their vehicles. More than 80% of the respondents said they would consider purchasing subscription-based services in the future. For investors who want to profit from this trend, here are the three best auto stocks to buy.
General Motors (GM)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
Modern electric vehicles are much more computerized than their gas-powered counterparts. Lucid Motors (NASDAQ: LCID ) CEO Peter Rawlinson explained in 2021 that computing has become central to vehicles, especially EVs. As a result, it’s much easier to offer software-based services through EVs than gas-powered vehicles. Consequently, automakers that sell many EVs will be much better positioned to offer software subscriptions.
Among the veteran automakers, General Motors (NYSE: GM ) is one of the best positioned firms to become a top seller of EVs. Sales of the Cadillac Lyriq luxury SUV jumped 500% last quarter year-over-year to 5,800. The Chevrolet Bolt was a top-selling EV in the U.S before it was taken off the market. However, GM is slated to release a retooled version of the Bolt next year . Moreover, the automaker has begun selling electric versions of many of its most popular trucks and SUVs. I believe that these will become best sellers in the longer term. Boding well for the future, GM expects its North American EV business to enter the black in the second half of this year.
Finally, GM reported very strong first-quarter results, has a very low valuation, and is returning a great deal of cash to its shareholders.
Rivian (RIVN)
Source: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com
How can anyone not love a company that’s an integral partner of both Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL )?
It appears that EV maker Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN ) could be on the verge of achieving that huge milestone. As of last October, the start-up had provided Amazon with 10,000 of the delivery vans that the e-commerce giant has ordered . And tech website DigiTimes recently reported that Apple is considering forming a partnership with Rivian.
Such an alliance would certainly make sense for Apple. Obviously, the software behemoth is interested in selling products via EVs. And Rivian is one of the top American EV -oriented firms.
Meanwhile, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe did not deny that the automaker could partner with Apple. He even noted that his company has a history of partnerships. Given these points, I think there’s a very high chance of the two firms forming an alliance. Such a deal should prove to be very lucrative for Rivian.
VinFast (VFS)
Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com
VinFast (NASDAQ: VFS ) is a Vietnam-based EV startup that’s growing very rapidly and has a semi-secret weapon. Last quarter the company’s sales soared 270% YOY to $302.65 million. Meanwhile, its EV deliveries jumped 444% YOY to 9,689.
The automaker’s semi-secret weapon is its alliance with Israeli EV battery maker StoreDot . The company’s batteries will be utilized by VinFast’s commercially available vehicles starting next year.
Another EV maker, Polestar (NASDAQ: PSNY ), recently reported that a test they conducted showed that StorDot’s battery can add 200 miles worth of charge in just 10 minutes.

2024-05-09,Strategically Rebalance Your Dividend Portfolio In May 2024 For Optimal Risk-Reward Outcomes,"Rebalancing your dividend portfolio is essential for long-term investment success. Doing so helps to maintain a consistently reduced risk level, thereby improving the likelihood of positive investment outcomes.
In today's article, I will analyze the risk level of the current composition of The Dividend Income Accelerator Portfolio to determine the most effective ways of rebalancing it.

Investment Thesis
Last week I received a message from a Seeking Alpha reader asking me about my plans to rebalance The Dividend Income Accelerator Portfolio (the portfolio I am constructing here on Seeking Alpha). This question has contributed to my decision to write an article dedicated to the topic.
I considered this to be an excellent question since I am convinced that periodically rebalancing your dividend income portfolio is crucial for maintaining a continuously reduced risk level, resulting in elevated chances of positive investment results over the long term....",14

2024-05-09,3 Promising Robotaxi Stocks to Snap Up Before August 8,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
When Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) announced its August 8 robotaxi event, enthusiasm for autonomous driving got a shot in the arm. Indeed, Tesla stock also received a much-needed jolt as it looked to reverse gears after a nasty drawdown.
Earlier this year, excitement and hope in full-self-driving ( FSD ) technology and the concept of robotaxis faded a bit. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) reportedly pulled the plug on its Apple Car (or Project Titan) program. However, Tesla’s August 8 event may very well bring to hype back. In any case, it will be very interesting to see if what Tesla unveils will help propel the robotaxi and autonomous driving trends back into the driver’s seat again.
Only time will tell what the big day will have in store for TSLA stock and self-driving plays as a whole. Regardless, I believe they’re worth watching (and perhaps buying) as they drive into August.
Tesla (TSLA)
Source: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com
It’s been an awful year for Tesla so far, with shares down 30% year-to-date. For now, not everybody is euphoric about Tesla. It has grappled with rough industry headwinds. Furthermore, considerable negative momentum weighing down its stock.
For the first quarter of 2024, deliveries were down 8.5% as electric vehicle ( EV ) demand took a breather. There doesn’t appear to be any signs of a swift reversal ahead for Tesla or the EV industry. However, investors could begin to be more forgiving of further weak quarterly results. They may hope that August 8 will unleash something truly game-changing for the robotaxi industry.
Also, the Robotaxi event will lay out a roadmap, perhaps a multi-year one, for the gradual release of its robotaxi. And, the degree of autonomy seems unlikely to be here yet. If Musk delivers more clarity and specifics on Tesla’s longer-term robotaxi plans, the firm may beckon longer-term investors to scoop up TSLA stock on weakness.
Baidu (BIDU)
Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ) is a Chinese internet juggernaut that has not been going anywhere fast. The stock is still down over 67% from its February 2021 peak. And, seems to be sinking again after a brief rebound in the back half of 2022.
With its latest agreement to provide mapping data to Tesla to help aid its FSD tech in China, BIDU is a must-watch stock. In fact, the deal stands out as a potentially huge win for both companies as they seek to collaborate. Many may underestimate the potential for a Tesla-Baidu partnership.
Tesla aside, Baidu has been working on its own autonomous driving tech for many years. Leveraging its AI expertise with its Apollo self-driving program, Baidu is a standout way to play the future of the robotaxi and FSD scene.
At 14.3 times trailing price-to-earnings ( P/E ), Baidu stands out as a potentially glorious bargain for investors willing to venture into the hard-hit Chinese market. The company is innovating on many fronts, from generative AI to self-driving.
Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)
Robotaxi and FSD projects represent just a small piece of the pie for Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ). It seeks to defend its Google search platform from potential AI disruptors while also betting big on AI itself. With its large language model ( LLM ) of Google Gemini and its stake in private AI firm Anthropic, Alphabet is a top-two AI stock to own for the long run.
Self-driving capabilities and AI go hand-in-hand. Its Waymo division is testing the roads (without a driver) in certain areas. So, it certainly seems like the emerging robotaxi market is Alphabet’s for the taking. And yet, Waymo isn’t quite perfect yet. A notable February accident could set a nationwide rollout back by quite a bit. In any case, I do not doubt Waymo will improve by leaps and bounds over time.
As a top rival of Tesla’s robotaxi, it will be interesting to see if Alphabet has anything in store for Waymo.

2024-05-09,The 3 Most Undervalued Under-$20 Stocks to Buy in May 2024,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Since the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 have gained 6% and 10% year-to-date, now is the time to buy undervalued stocks under $20.
Investors are anticipating three rate cuts from a now dovish Federal Reserve, and even though GDP growth slowed down in Q1 , corporate profits are strong, which is often a good sign of how healthy the market is.
Investors are happy because the economy is neither too hot (which may produce inflation and an overheated economy) nor too cold (which could bring a recession)— a Goldilocks state . This equilibrium boosts stock prices; Goldman Sachs predicts the S&P 500 will rise 6% to 4,700 in 2024.
In the middle of this, we will explore three undervalued stocks under $20, all with more than 50% upside.
The first competitor, a former mobile phone service giant, is making a strong return by shifting its focus to 5G technology. The second pick works in quantum computing, a niche area expected to expand by 33% in five years. The final stock is a key oil transportation provider, profiting from increased worldwide shipping costs.
Nokia (NOK)
Source: OleksSH / Shutterstock.com
Former mobile phone giant Nokia (NYSE: NOK ) is a 5G contender, with a potential 60% upside from a $6 average price target versus the last close of $3.74.
Nokia plans to achieve a 13% operating margin by 2026 in its new company strategy and business goals. To streamline operations and focus on 5G, safety, and SaaS, Nokia will sell Lumine Group its Device Management and Service Management Platform businesses to improve efficiency for $203.1 million.
Nokia’s portfolio management is shown by its sale of VitalQIP technology to Cygna Labs Corp. and the adoption of Red Hat as its network app infrastructure. Nokia is also changing how Mobile Networks work to expand its business into O-RAN, Cloud RAN, and the military.
Patents are very important to Nokia because they protect its new ideas and keep the company ahead of the competition in the tech industry. On that note, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Samsung now have long-term technology license deals with Nokia, covering cars, media players, and consumer gadgets.
Regarding recent milestones, Nokia finished the first Cloud RAN test with In-Line acceleration for MEA, which improved mobile network technology. Additionally, Nokia and Zayo set a record for North America’s longest live network transfer distance at 800Gb/s.
Finally, Nokia is developing new products and revamping models, such as the Nokia 2660 Flip, which has new colors. It also hints at a 5G version for India, perhaps the Nokia G42 5G.
IonQ (IONQ)
Source: Amin Van / Shutterstock.com
Quantum computing play IonQ (NYSE: IONQ ) is not profitable as of yet. However, considering the allure of quantum computing, a market expected to grow at 33% between 2024 and 2029, the market opportunity is tremendous, reflected by its “Strong Buy,” rating and 86% upside potential.
But the proof is in the pudding: IonQ reached 35 algorithmic qubits on its IonQ Forte platform, one year ahead of schedule, a major engineering milestone.
IonQ also took a big step toward building future quantum networks by adding to its technology skills. It’s working on adding optical interconnects to allow processing across quantum networks, which is very different from traditional setups, where work is split up among many separate cores and processors.
IonQ also revealed that the first specialized quantum computing production plant will open in the U.S. in Bothell, Washington. This is a big step toward making quantum computing available to the public.
Additionally, IonQ’s systems are now available on almost all major cloud platforms, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, and can accessed directly through APIs.
DHT Holdings (DHT)
Source: Shutterstock
DHT Holdings (NYSE: DHT ) completes our list of undervalued stocks under $20, a large oil tanker firm potentially benefitting from global shipping price improvements.
Wall Street analysts rate DHT a “moderate buy,” with an average price goal of $19, implying 63% upside.
DHT Holdings predicted $50,900 per day from time charters in Q1 2024 in April. Its spot market and time charter VLCCs make $54,000 and $39,500 daily, respectively. Despite being lower than the spot market, the time charter rate provides steady income, but spot market charters illustrate strong demand.
Along with the $54,200 discharge-to-discharge rate, 42% of second-quarter 2024 spot days are booked. Spot and time-charter days—54% of possible earnings—are at $46,900 per day.
Geopolitical energy and transportation events benefit DHT Holdings. The oil produced worldwide could go down by 500,000 to 2 million barrels per day in a “small disruption” scenario, increasing DHT Holdings’ oil tanker demand.
Middle Eastern conflict has increased “ton-miles” (cargo volume and distance) by raising crude oil prices and road length. Very large crude carriers, or VLCCs, allow DHT’s tanker fleet to transport large amounts over long hauls during geopolitical tensions, boosting profits.
DHT Holdings will build four VLCCs in South Korea from April to December 2026, helping leverage increased demand and charter prices.

2024-05-09,The 3 Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in May 2024,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
On May 4, value investing disciples trooped to Omaha, Nebraska, for Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE: BRK-A , NYSE: BRK-B ) annual general meeting. Everyone was eager to hear what Warren Buffett had to say about the economy and Berkshire’s operations. The company’s vaunted equity portfolio is a north star for many value investors seeking the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy.
Investors always want to follow Buffett, one of the greatest value investors of our time. The Oracle of Omaha sticks to value investing principles, purchasing high-quality businesses for a reasonable price.
Due to his strict selection criteria, the portfolio comprises some of the best wide-moat businesses. Even better, Buffett states his holding period is forever. So, his picks are businesses with durable competitive advantages that can compound earnings over decades. Looking at the current portfolio, here are some of the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is the largest holding in Berkshire’s equity portfolio, accounting for nearly 40% of holdings. That’s why the markets took note when Berkshire disclosed it trimmed its stake by 13% . However, Buffett quelled any fears about AAPL stock, saying it would continue to be Berkshire’s largest holding.
The iPhone maker suffered mixed fortunes in recent quarters. Although the company’s Services segment has been growing, product revenues are on the decline. As a result, total revenues declined in five of the last six quarters.
That said, the market is forward-looking. That is why the stock rallied over 6% on May 3 after Apple posted its results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Despite the revenue decline of 4.3% from a year ago, the market took positives from management commentary that iPhone revenues could begin growing again. Particularly encouraging was the rebound in China; CEO Tim Cook stated that he was very optimistic about the Chinese market in the long term .
However, artificial intelligence is the main catalyst that makes Apple one of the best Buffett stocks to buy. Management teased its AI rollout and investors are predicting a huge announcement at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June. For now, Apple is still a cash-generating machine and a $110 billion stock buyback will provide a floor on the stock.
Berkshire owns 789.6 million shares of AAPL stock, with its overall stake valued at $143.9 billion.
Coca-Cola (KO)
Source: MAHATHIR MOHD YASIN / Shutterstock.com
In terms of returns, Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ) has been one of the best investments Buffett has made. The soft drink giant retained its moat and earned impressive returns on equity since Buffett started buying in 1988. Still, it’s among the best Buffett stocks to buy. Berkshire currently holds 400 million shares of KO stock, a stake valued at $25.1 billion and 7% of Berkshire’s total portfolio.
Scanning the equity landscape, few companies have the brand strength of Coca-Cola. It sells 1.9 billion servings each day of its popular drinks in more than 200 countries. It is the most valuable soft drink brand , giving it immense pricing power. Additionally, its global scale provides a significant cost advantage against competition.
Indeed, Q1 2024 results proved that Coca-Cola’s brand strength remains intact. The results showed that it increased prices by 13% but still grew unit case volumes by 1%. This highlights that it can raise prices without pushback from consumers.
Due to its significant profitability, Coca-Cola is also a Dividend Aristocrat —an S&P 500 company that increased its dividend for 25 consecutive years. KO recorded 61 consecutive years of dividend growth, making it one of the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy for dividends.
As of this writing, KO stock trades for 21 times forward earnings. Quench your portfolio thirst and earn a 3.1% dividend yield.
American Express (AXP)

As one of the oldest portfolio holdings, American Express (NYSE: AXP ) deserves a mention due to its durability. The credit card company has been a mainstay in Buffett’s portfolio since the 1960s. Over the years, the business grew tremendously due to the shift from cards to cash.
The move to cards is still ongoing and that’s why AXP stock is one of the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy. According to recent results, the company isn’t resting on its laurels and is executing flawlessly. On April 19, it reported first-quarter revenues increased by 11% from a year ago to $15.8 billion. What’s more, diluted EPS increased from $2.40 to $3.33, an increase of 39%.
Management noted that it saw a high engagement level among premium customers. It expects the earnings momentum to continue as the company adds more members and spending increases in their high credit-quality cohort. In line with this view, they issued 2024 guidance of 9% to 11% revenue growth and EPS of $12.65 to $13.15.
The guidance means that AXP is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 18 times. Over the long term, the bet on millennials and Gen Z presents a significant growth runway. Furthermore, with only a 6% market share in its top five international markets, there is plenty of expansion upside.
Berkshire owns 151.6 million shares of AXP stock, or just more than 20% of the company’s total shares. The stake is valued at $37.5 billion and makes up nearly 10% of Berkshire’s total portfolio.

The market interpreted a softer non-farm payroll report as a sign of a slowing economy, potentially leading to a rate cut.
The Dividend Harvesting Portfolio increased in value and generated a record amount of weekly dividend income.
This was an interesting week as Amazon ( AMZN ) and Apple ( AAPL ) were the latest big tech companies to report earnings, rates remained unchanged at the FOMC meeting , Fed Chair Powell delivered a dovish press conference , and the labor report came in softer than expected. The Fed hasn't pivoted yet, as Chair Powell stated that the Fed needs to see more data that inflation isn't going to continue upward before they start the cutting process. What Fed Chair Powell said gave the market some clarity: a move higher in rates would be unlikely, and the next move the Fed would make would be a cut unless something drastically changes. After a softer non-farm payroll report where the U.S. added 175,000 jobs when the consensus number was 243,000, it looks like the market is interpreting that this could mean the economy is slowing and that the Fed will look at this data favorably.

2024-05-09,Berkshire Hathaway's Apple Stake Reduction: Likely A Macro Decision,"Berkshire Hathaway's decision to reduce its stake in Apple, while seemingly being painted as a tax-driven decision, might have hidden nuances.
Macroeconomic data from the Federal Reserve indicate rising financial stress on ordinary Americans, while perceptions shift around the likelihood of a hard landing.
If a recession is imminent, Berkshire Hathaway's massive cash position enables it to shift focus onto recession favorites such as financials and energy - sectors it's already strong in.
On the 4th of May, asset management firm Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRK.A and BRK.B ) announced in the course of its first quarter earnings release that its biggest bet - Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) - was worth $135.4 billion, implying that the former held around 790 million shares of the latter. This meant that the ""Oracle of Omaha"" (as Berkshire Hathaway principal Warren Buffett is often referred to as) has authorized the disposal of around 116 million shares, or 13% of its total stake in Apple.
Most ""Buffettologists"" would recognize that Berkshire Hathaway's investment style isn't known to be tactical; holding ""strong for long"" is the underlying message of their methodology. Apple is certainly one such example and for good reason: unlike fellow ""Magnificent Seven"" constituent Tesla ( TSLA ), Apple has only declined a little under 2% in the Year Till Date (YTD) despite signs of sales slowdown in major market China and signs of stagnation elsewhere. Furthermore, this is the second consecutive quarter wherein the company's Apple bet was cut: in the last quarter, around 1% of its held stake was disposed of....",14

2024-05-10,The 3 Best Auto Stocks to Buy in May 2024,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The auto sector is entering an exciting and more lucrative era. That’s because automakers are starting to charge subscription fees for high-tech services. I believe that these companies will soon also start offering to track the well-being of various components within vehicles in exchange for fees. Which may transform them into the one of the best auto stocks investors want to buy. Of course, for the owners of electric vehicles, keeping informed about the welfare and needs of their EV’s batteries is extremely important. As a result, I’m sure that many owners will be willing to pay to stay on top of those matters.
Importantly, most consumers seem willing to pay monthly fees for services within their vehicles. But they often like to try out these services first. In July 2023, S&P polled roughly 4,500 consumers who had a free trial or a subscription for services within their vehicles. More than 80% of the respondents said they would consider purchasing subscription-based services in the future. For investors who want to profit from this trend, here are the three best auto stocks to buy.
General Motors (GM)

Modern electric vehicles are much more computerized than their gas-powered counterparts. Lucid Motors (NASDAQ: LCID ) CEO Peter Rawlinson explained in 2021 that computing has become central to vehicles, especially EVs. As a result, it’s much easier to offer software-based services through EVs than gas-powered vehicles. Consequently, automakers that sell many EVs will be much better positioned to offer software subscriptions.
Among the veteran automakers, General Motors (NYSE: GM ) is one of the best positioned firms to become a top seller of EVs. Sales of the Cadillac Lyriq luxury SUV jumped 500% last quarter year-over-year to 5,800. The Chevrolet Bolt was a top-selling EV in the U.S before it was taken off the market. However, GM is slated to release a retooled version of the Bolt next year . Moreover, the automaker has begun selling electric versions of many of its most popular trucks and SUVs. I believe that these will become best sellers in the longer term. Boding well for the future, GM expects its North American EV business to enter the black in the second half of this year.
Finally, GM reported very strong first-quarter results, has a very low valuation, and is returning a great deal of cash to its shareholders.
Rivian (RIVN)

How can anyone not love a company that’s an integral partner of both Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL )?
It appears that EV maker Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN ) could be on the verge of achieving that huge milestone. As of last October, the start-up had provided Amazon with 10,000 of the delivery vans that the e-commerce giant has ordered . And tech website DigiTimes recently reported that Apple is considering forming a partnership with Rivian.
Such an alliance would certainly make sense for Apple. Obviously, the software behemoth is interested in selling products via EVs. And Rivian is one of the top American EV -oriented firms.
Meanwhile, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe did not deny that the automaker could partner with Apple. He even noted that his company has a history of partnerships. Given these points, I think there’s a very high chance of the two firms forming an alliance. Such a deal should prove to be very lucrative for Rivian.
VinFast (VFS)
Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com
VinFast (NASDAQ: VFS ) is a Vietnam-based EV startup that’s growing very rapidly and has a semi-secret weapon. Last quarter the company’s sales soared 270% YOY to $302.65 million. Meanwhile, its EV deliveries jumped 444% YOY to 9,689.
The automaker’s semi-secret weapon is its alliance with Israeli EV battery maker StoreDot . The company’s batteries will be utilized by VinFast’s commercially available vehicles starting next year.
Another EV maker, Polestar (NASDAQ: PSNY ), recently reported that a test they conducted showed that StorDot’s battery can add 200 miles worth of charge in just 10 minutes.

2024-05-09,3 Promising Robotaxi Stocks to Snap Up Before August 8,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
When Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) announced its August 8 robotaxi event, enthusiasm for autonomous driving got a shot in the arm. Indeed, Tesla stock also received a much-needed jolt as it looked to reverse gears after a nasty drawdown.
Earlier this year, excitement and hope in full-self-driving ( FSD ) technology and the concept of robotaxis faded a bit. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) reportedly pulled the plug on its Apple Car (or Project Titan) program. However, Tesla’s August 8 event may very well bring to hype back. In any case, it will be very interesting to see if what Tesla unveils will help propel the robotaxi and autonomous driving trends back into the driver’s seat again.
Only time will tell what the big day will have in store for TSLA stock and self-driving plays as a whole. Regardless, I believe they’re worth watching (and perhaps buying) as they drive into August.
Tesla (TSLA)
Source: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com
It’s been an awful year for Tesla so far, with shares down 30% year-to-date. For now, not everybody is euphoric about Tesla. It has grappled with rough industry headwinds. Furthermore, considerable negative momentum weighing down its stock.
For the first quarter of 2024, deliveries were down 8.5% as electric vehicle ( EV ) demand took a breather. There doesn’t appear to be any signs of a swift reversal ahead for Tesla or the EV industry. However, investors could begin to be more forgiving of further weak quarterly results. They may hope that August 8 will unleash something truly game-changing for the robotaxi industry.
Also, the Robotaxi event will lay out a roadmap, perhaps a multi-year one, for the gradual release of its robotaxi. And, the degree of autonomy seems unlikely to be here yet. If Musk delivers more clarity and specifics on Tesla’s longer-term robotaxi plans, the firm may beckon longer-term investors to scoop up TSLA stock on weakness.
Baidu (BIDU)
Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ) is a Chinese internet juggernaut that has not been going anywhere fast. The stock is still down over 67% from its February 2021 peak. And, seems to be sinking again after a brief rebound in the back half of 2022.
With its latest agreement to provide mapping data to Tesla to help aid its FSD tech in China, BIDU is a must-watch stock. In fact, the deal stands out as a potentially huge win for both companies as they seek to collaborate. Many may underestimate the potential for a Tesla-Baidu partnership.
Tesla aside, Baidu has been working on its own autonomous driving tech for many years. Leveraging its AI expertise with its Apollo self-driving program, Baidu is a standout way to play the future of the robotaxi and FSD scene.
At 14.3 times trailing price-to-earnings ( P/E ), Baidu stands out as a potentially glorious bargain for investors willing to venture into the hard-hit Chinese market. The company is innovating on many fronts, from generative AI to self-driving.
Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)
Robotaxi and FSD projects represent just a small piece of the pie for Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ). It seeks to defend its Google search platform from potential AI disruptors while also betting big on AI itself. With its large language model ( LLM ) of Google Gemini and its stake in private AI firm Anthropic, Alphabet is a top-two AI stock to own for the long run.
Self-driving capabilities and AI go hand-in-hand. Its Waymo division is testing the roads (without a driver) in certain areas. So, it certainly seems like the emerging robotaxi market is Alphabet’s for the taking. And yet, Waymo isn’t quite perfect yet. A notable February accident could set a nationwide rollout back by quite a bit. In any case, I do not doubt Waymo will improve by leaps and bounds over time.
As a top rival of Tesla’s robotaxi, it will be interesting to see if Alphabet has anything in store for Waymo.

2024-05-09,The 3 Most Undervalued Under-$20 Stocks to Buy in May 2024,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Since the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 have gained 6% and 10% year-to-date, now is the time to buy undervalued stocks under $20.
Investors are anticipating three rate cuts from a now dovish Federal Reserve, and even though GDP growth slowed down in Q1 , corporate profits are strong, which is often a good sign of how healthy the market is.
Investors are happy because the economy is neither too hot (which may produce inflation and an overheated economy) nor too cold (which could bring a recession)— a Goldilocks state . This equilibrium boosts stock prices; Goldman Sachs predicts the S&P 500 will rise 6% to 4,700 in 2024.
In the middle of this, we will explore three undervalued stocks under $20, all with more than 50% upside.
The first competitor, a former mobile phone service giant, is making a strong return by shifting its focus to 5G technology. The second pick works in quantum computing, a niche area expected to expand by 33% in five years. The final stock is a key oil transportation provider, profiting from increased worldwide shipping costs.
Nokia (NOK)
Source: OleksSH / Shutterstock.com
Former mobile phone giant Nokia (NYSE: NOK ) is a 5G contender, with a potential 60% upside from a $6 average price target versus the last close of $3.74.
Nokia plans to achieve a 13% operating margin by 2026 in its new company strategy and business goals. To streamline operations and focus on 5G, safety, and SaaS, Nokia will sell Lumine Group its Device Management and Service Management Platform businesses to improve efficiency for $203.1 million.
Nokia’s portfolio management is shown by its sale of VitalQIP technology to Cygna Labs Corp. and the adoption of Red Hat as its network app infrastructure. Nokia is also changing how Mobile Networks work to expand its business into O-RAN, Cloud RAN, and the military.
Patents are very important to Nokia because they protect its new ideas and keep the company ahead of the competition in the tech industry. On that note, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Samsung now have long-term technology license deals with Nokia, covering cars, media players, and consumer gadgets.
Regarding recent milestones, Nokia finished the first Cloud RAN test with In-Line acceleration for MEA, which improved mobile network technology. Additionally, Nokia and Zayo set a record for North America’s longest live network transfer distance at 800Gb/s.
Finally, Nokia is developing new products and revamping models, such as the Nokia 2660 Flip, which has new colors. It also hints at a 5G version for India, perhaps the Nokia G42 5G.
IonQ (IONQ)
Source: Amin Van / Shutterstock.com
Quantum computing play IonQ (NYSE: IONQ ) is not profitable as of yet. However, considering the allure of quantum computing, a market expected to grow at 33% between 2024 and 2029, the market opportunity is tremendous, reflected by its “Strong Buy,” rating and 86% upside potential.
But the proof is in the pudding: IonQ reached 35 algorithmic qubits on its IonQ Forte platform, one year ahead of schedule, a major engineering milestone.
IonQ also took a big step toward building future quantum networks by adding to its technology skills. It’s working on adding optical interconnects to allow processing across quantum networks, which is very different from traditional setups, where work is split up among many separate cores and processors.
IonQ also revealed that the first specialized quantum computing production plant will open in the U.S. in Bothell, Washington. This is a big step toward making quantum computing available to the public.
Additionally, IonQ’s systems are now available on almost all major cloud platforms, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, and can accessed directly through APIs.
DHT Holdings (DHT)
Source: Shutterstock
DHT Holdings (NYSE: DHT ) completes our list of undervalued stocks under $20, a large oil tanker firm potentially benefitting from global shipping price improvements.
Wall Street analysts rate DHT a “moderate buy,” with an average price goal of $19, implying 63% upside.
DHT Holdings predicted $50,900 per day from time charters in Q1 2024 in April. Its spot market and time charter VLCCs make $54,000 and $39,500 daily, respectively. Despite being lower than the spot market, the time charter rate provides steady income, but spot market charters illustrate strong demand.
Along with the $54,200 discharge-to-discharge rate, 42% of second-quarter 2024 spot days are booked. Spot and time-charter days—54% of possible earnings—are at $46,900 per day.
Geopolitical energy and transportation events benefit DHT Holdings. The oil produced worldwide could go down by 500,000 to 2 million barrels per day in a “small disruption” scenario, increasing DHT Holdings’ oil tanker demand.
Middle Eastern conflict has increased “ton-miles” (cargo volume and distance) by raising crude oil prices and road length. Very large crude carriers, or VLCCs, allow DHT’s tanker fleet to transport large amounts over long hauls during geopolitical tensions, boosting profits.
DHT Holdings will build four VLCCs in South Korea from April to December 2026, helping leverage increased demand and charter prices.

2024-05-09,The 3 Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in May 2024,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
On May 4, value investing disciples trooped to Omaha, Nebraska, for Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE: BRK-A , NYSE: BRK-B ) annual general meeting. Everyone was eager to hear what Warren Buffett had to say about the economy and Berkshire’s operations. The company’s vaunted equity portfolio is a north star for many value investors seeking the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy.
Investors always want to follow Buffett, one of the greatest value investors of our time. The Oracle of Omaha sticks to value investing principles, purchasing high-quality businesses for a reasonable price.
Due to his strict selection criteria, the portfolio comprises some of the best wide-moat businesses. Even better, Buffett states his holding period is forever. So, his picks are businesses with durable competitive advantages that can compound earnings over decades. Looking at the current portfolio, here are some of the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is the largest holding in Berkshire’s equity portfolio, accounting for nearly 40% of holdings. That’s why the markets took note when Berkshire disclosed it trimmed its stake by 13% . However, Buffett quelled any fears about AAPL stock, saying it would continue to be Berkshire’s largest holding.
The iPhone maker suffered mixed fortunes in recent quarters. Although the company’s Services segment has been growing, product revenues are on the decline. As a result, total revenues declined in five of the last six quarters.
That said, the market is forward-looking. That is why the stock rallied over 6% on May 3 after Apple posted its results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Despite the revenue decline of 4.3% from a year ago, the market took positives from management commentary that iPhone revenues could begin growing again. Particularly encouraging was the rebound in China; CEO Tim Cook stated that he was very optimistic about the Chinese market in the long term .
However, artificial intelligence is the main catalyst that makes Apple one of the best Buffett stocks to buy. Management teased its AI rollout and investors are predicting a huge announcement at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June. For now, Apple is still a cash-generating machine and a $110 billion stock buyback will provide a floor on the stock.
Berkshire owns 789.6 million shares of AAPL stock, with its overall stake valued at $143.9 billion.
Coca-Cola (KO)
Source: MAHATHIR MOHD YASIN / Shutterstock.com
In terms of returns, Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ) has been one of the best investments Buffett has made. The soft drink giant retained its moat and earned impressive returns on equity since Buffett started buying in 1988. Still, it’s among the best Buffett stocks to buy. Berkshire currently holds 400 million shares of KO stock, a stake valued at $25.1 billion and 7% of Berkshire’s total portfolio.
Scanning the equity landscape, few companies have the brand strength of Coca-Cola. It sells 1.9 billion servings each day of its popular drinks in more than 200 countries. It is the most valuable soft drink brand , giving it immense pricing power. Additionally, its global scale provides a significant cost advantage against competition.
Indeed, Q1 2024 results proved that Coca-Cola’s brand strength remains intact. The results showed that it increased prices by 13% but still grew unit case volumes by 1%. This highlights that it can raise prices without pushback from consumers.
Due to its significant profitability, Coca-Cola is also a Dividend Aristocrat —an S&P 500 company that increased its dividend for 25 consecutive years. KO recorded 61 consecutive years of dividend growth, making it one of the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy for dividends.
As of this writing, KO stock trades for 21 times forward earnings. Quench your portfolio thirst and earn a 3.1% dividend yield.
American Express (AXP)
Source: Shutterstock
As one of the oldest portfolio holdings, American Express (NYSE: AXP ) deserves a mention due to its durability. The credit card company has been a mainstay in Buffett’s portfolio since the 1960s. Over the years, the business grew tremendously due to the shift from cards to cash.
The move to cards is still ongoing and that’s why AXP stock is one of the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy. According to recent results, the company isn’t resting on its laurels and is executing flawlessly. On April 19, it reported first-quarter revenues increased by 11% from a year ago to $15.8 billion. What’s more, diluted EPS increased from $2.40 to $3.33, an increase of 39%.
Management noted that it saw a high engagement level among premium customers. It expects the earnings momentum to continue as the company adds more members and spending increases in their high credit-quality cohort. In line with this view, they issued 2024 guidance of 9% to 11% revenue growth and EPS of $12.65 to $13.15.
The guidance means that AXP is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 18 times. Over the long term, the bet on millennials and Gen Z presents a significant growth runway. Furthermore, with only a 6% market share in its top five international markets, there is plenty of expansion upside.
Berkshire owns 151.6 million shares of AXP stock, or just more than 20% of the company’s total shares. The stake is valued at $37.5 billion and makes up nearly 10% of Berkshire’s total portfolio.

2024-05-09,"Dividend Harvesting Portfolio Week 166: $16,600 Allocated, $1,490.16 In Projected Dividends","Amazon and Apple reported earnings, while the Fed Chair stated that a rate cut is likely unless there are significant changes.
The market interpreted a softer non-farm payroll report as a sign of a slowing economy, potentially leading to a rate cut.
The Dividend Harvesting Portfolio increased in value and generated a record amount of weekly dividend income.
This was an interesting week as Amazon ( AMZN ) and Apple ( AAPL ) were the latest big tech companies to report earnings, rates remained unchanged at the FOMC meeting , Fed Chair Powell delivered a dovish press conference , and the labor report came in softer than expected. The Fed hasn't pivoted yet, as Chair Powell stated that the Fed needs to see more data that inflation isn't going to continue upward before they start the cutting process. What Fed Chair Powell said gave the market some clarity: a move higher in rates would be unlikely, and the next move the Fed would make would be a cut unless something drastically changes. After a softer non-farm payroll report where the U.S. added 175,000 jobs when the consensus number was 243,000, it looks like the market is interpreting that this could mean the economy is slowing and that the Fed will look at this data favorably. The S&P 500 was falling into the Fed meeting as it stated the week at 5,119.85 and reached 5,014.74 prior to the FOMC meeting, but finished the week up 0.15% as it closed at 5,127.79. The Nasdaq had a similar arc in the week, as it started the week on the decline but finished up 0.91%....",15
2024-05-09,Berkshire Hathaway's Apple Stake Reduction: Likely A Macro Decision,"Berkshire Hathaway's decision to reduce its stake in Apple, while seemingly being painted as a tax-driven decision, might have hidden nuances.
Macroeconomic data from the Federal Reserve indicate rising financial stress on ordinary Americans, while perceptions shift around the likelihood of a hard landing.
If a recession is imminent, Berkshire Hathaway's massive cash position enables it to shift focus onto recession favorites such as financials and energy - sectors it's already strong in.
On the 4th of May, asset management firm Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRK.A and BRK.B ) announced in the course of its first quarter earnings release that its biggest bet - Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) - was worth $135.4 billion, implying that the former held around 790 million shares of the latter. This meant that the ""Oracle of Omaha"" (as Berkshire Hathaway principal Warren Buffett is often referred to as) has authorized the disposal of around 116 million shares, or 13% of its total stake in Apple.
Most ""Buffettologists"" would recognize that Berkshire Hathaway's investment style isn't known to be tactical; holding ""strong for long"" is the underlying message of their methodology. Apple is certainly one such example and for good reason: unlike fellow ""Magnificent Seven"" constituent Tesla ( TSLA ), Apple has only declined a little under 2% in the Year Till Date (YTD) despite signs of sales slowdown in major market China and signs of stagnation elsewhere. Furthermore, this is the second consecutive quarter wherein the company's Apple bet was cut: in the last quarter, around 1% of its held stake was disposed of....",15

Apple focuses on innovation and cost-cutting, exemplified by Apple Silicon CPUs. Net income and operating income have been growing faster than revenue.
Smartphone and consumer electronics markets show steady growth, along with potential in accessories and cloud gaming.

The company released Q2 2024 earnings on May 2 . The company beat EPS and revenue estimates by a slim margin of 0.02% and 2.09% respectively. The company also increased the dividend to $0.25 per share (which is a 4% increase), as well as announced a $110B stock buyback program....",16
2024-05-08,Buffett's Banking Bets: Analyzing the 3 Largest Bank Stocks in Berkshire's Portfolio,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Even before last year’s regional banking crisis, Warren Buffett was bailing on bank stocks . Gone from the portfolio were long-time holdings like Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ), U.S. Bank (NYSE: USB ) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ).
He became disenchanted with the financial institutions and how they operated. He thought they were taking “dumb” risks and were misleading investors by using deceptive accounting tricks to pad their bottom lines. After seeing some red flags in their financial statements, Buffett dumped their shares from Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A )(NYSE: BRK-B ).
The subsequent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank seemed to prove just what Buffett was saying.
And yet Buffett didn’t sell all of his bank stocks. In fact, he owns six bank stocks, a few acquired after he dumped many of the old line banks. For example, Nu Holdings (NASDAQ: NU ), a new-fangled, all-digital Brazilian banking outfit, was bought in 2021. Recently he acquired stock in five Japanese banks , businesses he says he believes their United States counterparts could learn a lot from.
Below are three Warren Buffett bank stocks that comprise the largest holdings in Berkshire Hathaway.
Buffet’s Bank Stocks: Citigroup (C)

Citigroup (NYSE: C ) is performing more like an artificial intelligence stock than a bank stock. Shares of the financial firm are up 63% from the lows hit last October and are running 21% higher in 2024. That vindicates the support Buffett has provided the bank, which assumes almost 1% in his portfolio.
The bank is undergoing a turnaround that is supercharging the stock. It reported first-quarter results last month that were better than Wall street expected. Revenue rose 1% from last year to $21.1 billion, better than analyst expectations of $20.4 billion. Although profits dropped 28% to $1.58 per share, they were much better than the consensus outlook of $1.20 per share. But Citi has now completed its overhaul that sought to significantly reduce costs, in part by effecting dramatic job cuts. It is also selling off over a dozen retail banking businesses.
Banking was Citi’s top-performing segment in the quarter as revenue jumped 49% on the surprising strength of investment banking and corporate lending. The bank’s return on tangible common equity improved dramatically to 9.9% from 1% last year and a negative 6.6% in the fourth quarter.
Buffett owns 55.2 million shares of Citigroup, or 2.9% of the bank’s outstanding shares.
American Express (AXP)
Source: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com
Thought of as mostly as credit card company, American Express (NYSE: AXP ) also offers savings accounts and certificates of deposit online. It also has an online bank called American Express National Bank with savings and checking accounts.
American Express is one of Buffett’s oldest holdings, first acquired back in 1991. Remarkably, he has not bought a single share of AmEx since the late 1990s but time and the effects of compounding allowed it to become the fourth biggest position in Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio. Buffett owns 151.6 million shares of the financial company or 21.1% of the total outstanding shares. With the stake valued at $35.4 billion, American Express occupies nearly 10% of the portfolio’s total.
AmEx also reported better-than-expected results with net interest income (NII), or the amount of money it earns from customers who keep a balance on their accounts, jumping 26% from last year. Not everyone fears the higher interest rates the Federal Reserve is charging. But by also targeting a younger demographic , American Express is enjoying significant growth. Chairman and CEO Stephen Squeri said  millennials and Gen Z consumers “accounted for over 60 percent of new consumer account acquisitions globally.”
Bank of America (BAC)
Source: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.com
The premiere Warren Buffett bank stock is Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ). It was also one of the bank stocks he was buying as the regional banking crisis shook faith in the country’s financial foundations. It took his holdings to over 1 billion shares , or 13.2% of the outstanding total.
At today’s prices, that stake is valued it at $38.8 billion, only surpassed by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) at $144 billion. As it is, the bank represents 10.7% of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio.
The financial giant, one of the biggest banks in the country, has also benefited from high interest rates boosting NII. While it also increased unrealized losses , Bank of America should be able to outlast the storm until those assets come to maturity. The stock market appreciates the stability the bank offers as shares have shot 50% higher from their lows and stand 12% above where they started 2024.
There is no indication Buffett plans to pare his stake in Bank of America as he has been doing with Apple and it will remain a stalwart of Berkshire Hathaway.

2024-05-08,3 Tech Stock Darlings to Scoop Up After Q2 earnings,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Over the past year, advancements in artificial intelligence ( AI ), cloud computing and cybersecurity propelled the tech sector to new Wall Street heights. As a result, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index has returned over 35% in the past 12 months. Now that we are well into the second-quarter earnings season, investors are looking for tech stocks to buy after earnings.
Despite the decline in the tech sector in April, many positive earnings surprises across sectors have led to renewed optimism on Wall Street. And, the “Magnificent Seven” stocks, namely Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) (NASDAQ: GOOG ), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ), are once again on investors’ radars.
Analysts have also been endorsing a number of tech darlings, especially citing AI’s role in the sector’s growth. For instance, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) recently raised Apple’s target price post-earnings , noting the quarterly performance, stock buyback and hints at AI updates to come. With that in mind, let’s explore three tech stocks to to buy after earnings.
Amazon (AMZN)
Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com
The first company is Amazon, which reported impressive Q1 2024 financials on April 30. Revenues surged 13% year-over-year ( YOY ) to $143 billion, driven by strong e-commerce and Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) performance. Net income tripled to $10.4 billion, or 98 cents per diluted share, compared to the same period last year. Additionally, the company’s free cash flow surged to $50 billion. This is a notable improvement from the $3.3 billion outflow in the previous year.
Apart from a strong retail business fueled by robust consumer demand, Amazon’s strategic emphasis on AI infrastructure positions it for further growth. Innovations such as the Trainium and Inferentia chips optimize machine learning tasks, ensuring efficiency. Furthermore, the AI services platform, Bedrock, streamlines deployment and customization . And, third-party applications utilizing Amazon’s infrastructure expand its market presence and reach.
As a result, AMZN stock has gained 22% year-to-date ( YTD ). Meanwhile, the shares are changing hands at 41 times forward earnings and three times trailing sales. Despite the relatively high valuation, analysts foresee further upside. They set a 12-month price target of $220, suggesting an 18% potential increase from current levels. Interested investors may consider the $180 level as a better entry point into Amazon shares.
iShares U.S. Technology ETF (IYW)

Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices , noted that the information technology and communication services sectors, which comprise the majority of the tech industry, drove over 70% of the S&P 500 ’s total return of 26.3% in 2023. The “Magnificent Seven” played a significant role in this rally, contributing around 60% of the index’s total return.
Therefore, the iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSEARCA: IYW ) stands out as a compelling choice . This ETF provides a gateway to a diverse group of U.S. tech companies, reflecting a blend of established players and innovative disruptors.
Since its inception in May 2000, IYW has demonstrated remarkable growth, now boasting net assets totaling $16 billion. The fund offers a comprehensive portfolio comprising 131 holdings, with the top ten commanding approximately 65% of the allocation.
Among its leading holdings are tech giants Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Alphabet. The fund maintains a diversified spread across sectors, including Software & Services (40%), Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment (30%), Tech Hardware & Equipment (18%) and Media & Entertainment (10%).
IYW is up nearly 8% YTD and has gained almost 44% over the past 12 months, outperforming the broad S&P 500 index as well as the Nasdaq 100 index. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios stand at around 36.5x and 9.5x, respectively. Finally, investors should note IYW’s expense ratio of 0.4%.
Qualcomm (QCOM)
Source: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com
Our final pick among top tech stocks to buy earnings is Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ). The leading global provider of semiconductor solutions and wireless technology operates through Qualcomm CDMA Technologies ( QCT ) and Qualcomm Technology Licensing ( QTL ). QCT generates revenue from chipsets for the telecommunications industry, while QTL manages patent licensing.
Recently, QCOM stock hit an all-time high after releasing impressive second-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings. The company reported $9.4 billion in non-GAAP revenues, a 1% increase from the previous year’s quarter, and $2.44 in diluted earnings per share, a 13% rise YOY that exceeded guidance. Notably, QCT Automotive saw exceptional growth, with a 35% surge in revenues due to expanded content in new vehicle launches featuring Snapdragon Digital Chassis products.
Investors have been following the anticipated demand for AI-equipped premium smartphones. Going forward, the company’s strategic diversification into emerging sectors like automotive, IoT and networking underscores Qualcomm’s commitment to long-term sustainability and revenue diversification.
So far in 2024, QCOM shares have returned 24%, and currently trade at around 19 times forward earnings and six times trailing sales, indicating a relatively premium valuation. Nonetheless, analysts’ price targets of $185 still imply an average upside potential of 3% from current levels. Finally, the stock also offers a 1.9% dividend yield.

2024-05-08,PayPal Stock Analysis: Why PYPL Is Still a Huge Bargain Right Now,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
In a column about PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL ) published on Oct. 19, 2023, I wrote that “PYPL stock trades at bargain-basement levels and has a new, up-and-coming CEO. Additionally, I believe the Street is overly worried about threats to PayPal’s dominance.” And I advised investors to “buy the shares on weakness.”
That turned out to be pretty good advice as shares jumped 20% between Oct. 19 and May 6. Also noteworthy is that, during the same period, the shares of SoFi (NASDAQ: SOFI ), a popular fintech name that I’ve been bearish on, fell 6%. And now, after PayPal reported standout first-quarter results and with its shares still trading at very low valuations, I continue to recommend that growth-at-a-reasonable-price investors buy the shares. Also importantly, the company has multiple, potential and strong positive catalysts.
PayPal’s Strong Q1 Results
The fintech giant’s top line advanced 9.4% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier to $7.7 billion while its total payment volume (TPV) jumped an impressive 14% year-over-year ( YOY ) to $404 billion and its earnings per share rose 27% YOY to $1.08.
The company’s continued strong revenue and TPV growth show that the Street’s worries about the firm losing market share to Apple ‘s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Apple Pay are completely unfounded. And the large increase in its EPS suggests that the cost controls implemented by the firm’s new CEO Alex Chriss are bearing fruit.
Low Valuation + Positive Catalysts = Buy
Despite the recent, strong gains of PayPal stock, the name’s valuation continues to be exceptionally low and attractive.
Indeed, the shares have a forward price-earnings ratio of 15.3x and an enterprise value/EBITDA ratio of 9.2 times. Given PayPal’s rapid revenue growth and the large increase in its profits, I believe that the stock remains extremely undervalued.
On the catalyst front, the firm is testing a new, fast checkout feature. According to Chriss, almost 80% of the consumers who have used the feature in tests utilize PayPal to pay when they check out again. Moreover, the conversion rates of the merchants who use it rise about 10%, the CEO reported.
Given these points, I believe that this offering will significantly increase PayPal’s payment volumes while enabling it to convince more vendors to utilize its platform.
Chriss also indicated that the firm is working harder than under his predecessor to market its fraud-prevention solution. Finally, PayPal has been convincing more small and medium businesses to use its Complete Payments suite. The CEO indicated that the companies that utilize this offering use more of PayPal’s products.
Finally, Chriss suggested that he would meaningfully increase the company’s low prices going forward.
Over the longer term, I expect these initiatives, taken together, to enable the growth of PayPal’s top and bottom lines to meaningfully accelerate.
Plenty of runway for growth
There are other indications besides the low valuation of the shares which suggest that the name can advance a great deal.
First,the average price target of Street analysts on the stock is $71.48, meaningfully above its current price of around $65. Second, out of 35 analysts who cover the name, only 15 of them have “buy” ratings on the shares. As more of these analysts “see the light” and upgrade the shares, they are likely to rise meaningfully.
Finally, the shares have a low Relative Strength rating of 48 and an average Accumulation/Distribution rating of C, according to Investor’s Business Daily . These metrics indicate that the stock has underperformed in the last year, while institutions have not bought a great deal of its in the last 13 weeks. As many more investors realize that PayPal stock is a bargain ,the shares should rally a great deal.

2024-05-08,Which Credit Bureau Stock Should You Buy for the Long-Term?,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
When you write about the markets as much as I do, finding subjects to cover is challenging. A recent New York Times article about “Pay Later” lenders gave me an idea about credit bureau stocks to buy.
The Times article discussed how credit bureaus want to start including “buy now, pay later” purchases on consumer credit reports and credit scores.
This was prompted by Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) February move to start reporting loans made through its Apple Pay Later service to Experian (OTCMKTS: EXPGY ), one of the three main credit bureaus.
A major issue with not reporting the loans is that it creates what experts call “phantom debt.” The credit bureaus argue that by including them, consumers are building credit. Pay-later lenders argue that each purchase makes a separate loan, hurting a consumer’s credit score.
Ultimately, the Times article concluded that pay-later firms will either be forced by regulators to report pay-later loans or market forces, such as loan delinquencies, will get them to act.
Either way, the three credit bureaus —Experian, TransUnion (NYSE: TRU ), and Equifax (NYSE: EFX )—should remain integral to the lending industry.
One’s a Buy, one’s a Hold, and one’s a Sell.
Experian (EXPGY)
Source: ©iStock.com/ebstock
Seventeen analysts cover Experian. Of those, 14 rate it a Buy, with a $44.94 target price, about 9% higher than its current share price. Of the three stocks, Experian has the highest approval rating from analysts.
Experian’s investor relations website cites five reasons why you should invest in the company: 1) It’s a market leader, 2) it has a purpose-driven growth strategy, 3) it has a sustainable focus and strong commitment to ESG, 4) it is financially sound, and 5) it has a rock-solid foundation for growth.
That’s corporate speak, for it’s one heck of a company.
In its latest presentation, the company points out that its 2023 revenue of $6.62 billion was higher than Equifax ($5.12 billion) and TransUnion ($3.71 billion). Further, it has the most globally diverse revenue, with 33% outside North America compared to 22% and 20% for the other two, respectively.
The company estimates its global addressable market opportunity is $150 billion annually. That’s a double-edged sword. On the one hand, there’s tremendous growth potential. On the other hand, it’s not going to be easy or cheap to grab a bigger piece of the pie.
When in doubt, I look to free cash flow to decide if a company has what it takes for the long haul. In 2023, it was $1.11 billion , down from $1.31 billion a year earlier. Based on an enterprise value of $41.34 billion , it has a free cash flow yield of 2.7%. Anything under 4% is overvalued.
Experian is a Buy.
TransUnion (TRU)
Source: Shutterstock
TransUnion is covered by 20 analysts . Of those, 16 rate it a Buy, with a $90.00 target price, about 14% higher than its current share price.
As I wrote in the previous section, TransUnion has the lowest annual revenue of the three credit bureaus. However, it’s nearly doubled since hitting a 52-week low of $42.09 in November 2023. Here’s why.
In Q1 2024, TransUnion delivered $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time in its history, up 8%, excluding currency, to $1.02 billion. Every region experienced a year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, its adjusted net income for the quarter was $179 million, 16% higher than Q1 2023.
“We are raising our 2024 guidance following first quarter outperformance and now expect to deliver 5 to 6.5 percent revenue growth for the year. We remain focused on driving strong results in a low-growth market environment, with no assumed in-year benefits from interest rate cuts,” stated CEO Chris Cartwright in its Q1 2024 press release.
In 2023, TransUnion’s free cash flow was $334.70 million . Based on an enterprise value of $20.08 billion , it has a free cash flow yield of 1.7%. Anything under 4% is overvalued.
TransUnion is a Hold.
Equifax (EFX)
Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.com
Equifax is covered by 23 analysts . Of those, 18 rate it a Buy, with a $267.30 target price, about 16% higher than its current share price.
Over the past year, Equifax stock has increased 15%, less than TransUnion, which has increased 21%, or Experian, which has increased 21.5%. That’s the bad news. The good news is that Equifax has significantly outperformed its two competitors over the past five years.
Equifax was founded in Atlanta in 1899 as Retail Credit Company . It changed its name to Equifax in 1975 .
Equifax reported its Q1 2024 results in mid-April. Revenues, excluding currency, increased by 8% to $1.39 billion, while its net income rose 11% to $124.9 million. For all of 2024, it expects revenue of $5.72 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, 8.5% higher than 2023, with adjusted earnings per share of $7.35, 9.5% higher than a year ago .
In 2023, Equifax’s free cash flow was $515.5 million [operating cash flow of $1.12 billion less $601.3 million in capital expenditures], up considerably from 2023. Based on an enterprise value of $33.64 billion , it has a free cash flow yield of 1.5%. Anything under 4% is overvalued.
Equifax is a Sell.

With iPhone sales declining and Apple facing intense competition, it's fair to consider if it is best to stop viewing Apple as a growth stock and reclassify it as a premium dividend-paying, blue-chip company. Let's find out if that reclassification would make Apple overvalued relative to other opportunities.

Apple’s $110B buyback is larger than the market caps of 418 S&P 500 stocks",16
2024-05-07,"Forget the ""Magnificent Seven"": 1 TSX Tech Stock to Buy Instead","The ‘Magnificent Seven’ have certainly proven to be quite magnificent over the last few years. These companies include Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG )( NASDAQ:GOOGL ), Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ), Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), Meta ( NASDAQ:META ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) and Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ). In fact, the seven largest stocks by market cap on the S&P 500 were pretty much holding up the index, taking up about 30% of the overall index.
So while it looked like the S&P 500 was doing really well, it really came down to these absolutely enormous companies. And that led many investors to have a few worries. So let’s get into what those worries were, and why there’s another TSX tech stock to consider instead.
Worry flurry
The fear was that with the S&P 500 running higher and higher due to the heavy investment in these seven companies, should the companies drop the market could crash. And while that didn’t exactly happen, there was proof of the hypothesis on the markets.
The ‘Magnificent Seven’ reported their earnings near the beginning of 2024, and each did quite well overall. This led to a surge in the S&P 500, with shares continuing to rise higher and higher between January and the end of March.
However, by the time earnings started to come forward once more, and there was still no drop in interest rates, investors began to fear the positivity would’t continue. This led to a drop in the S&P 500, with investments in major companies like Nvidia stock seeing a massive drop in share price.
Consider sectors
That’s why the historically safe S&P 500 hasn’t been all that safe recently. Until there is more exposure to other companies and areas of the market, I would instead consider diversifying. And that should mean looking at strong sectors that are due to continue rising.
One area is the market of semiconductors . As mentioned, shares of Nvidia stock rose higher as the company not only demonstrated its worth in current earnings, but expects even more in the future.
Yet shares of Nvidia stock are now quite expensive. With that in mind, I would instead look at companies that are involved in the semiconductor process. And Celestica ( TSX:CLS ) is perhaps the best option on the TSX today.
Why Celestica stock?
There are many reasons to consider Celestica stock on the TSX today, especially if you’re looking to invest in semiconductors stocks. Celestica stock operates in the semiconductor industry as a provider of manufacturing services and solutions for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Investing in Celestica can provide diversification within the semiconductor sector, as it offers exposure to semiconductor-related activities beyond semiconductor manufacturing itself.
Furthermore, Celestica offers a range of supply chain services, including design, engineering, manufacturing, and aftermarket services. This diversification of services can mitigate some of the risks associated with pure-play semiconductor companies that may be more exposed to fluctuations in chip demand or pricing.
The company has proven its worth as well, seeing shares surge by 303% in the last year alone! And yet as of writing, shares are below 52-week highs. Therefore, it’s a great time for investors to consider picking up Celestica stock on the TSX today. Especially if they want to get away from the over-exposure of the “Magnificent Seven” stocks.

2024-05-07,New Apple M4 Chip Threatens to Dethrone Nvidia (NVDA) Stock,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
One tech leader is gearing up to challenge Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) as a powerful new rival. Indeed, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) reportedly wants to produce its own chips for artificial intelligence ( AI ) software in data centers. According to The Wall Street Journal , the company has been working on this device — internally codenamed Project ACDC (Apple Chips in Data Center) — for years.
Apple hasn’t officially commented on this server project yet. But it recently reminded investors that it’s taking major steps toward cementing its place in the AI race. Today, the tech firm also announced that its M4 system on a chip (SoC) will power the new iPad Pro. AAPL stock closed the day in the green amid growing enthusiasm for the Silicon Valley darling.
Of course, this is good news for Apple. But if the company’s foray into AI and chips continues, Nvidia may finally have an opponent to seriously threaten its market share.
AAPL Stock in the Age of the M4 Chip
Tech enthusiasts would likely have lined up for the new iPad Pro no matter what. But with the added incentive of a powerful new chip helping usher in a new stage of the AI revolution, interest in this sleek new device will be even higher. With that in mind, it’s easy to see why AAPL stock surged today and NVDA stock dipped, as the threat of a dangerous new competitor may be beginning to loom.
What makes the M4 chip special? Apple provided an in-depth overview of why this innovation matters for both investors and consumers:
“[The] M4 has Apple’s fastest Neural Engine ever, capable of up to 38 trillion operations per second, which is faster than the neural processing unit of any AI PC today. Combined with faster memory bandwidth, along with next-generation machine learning ( ML ) accelerators in the CPU, and a high-performance GPU, M4 makes the new iPad Pro an outrageously powerful device for artificial intelligence.”
This catalyst is likely exactly what Apple needs to bolster to its place as a pillar of Silicon Valley. Despite some recent momentum, AAPL stock remains in the red so far this year and some experts have expressed concern . One analyst at Barclays recently reiterated a “sell” rating on AAPL stock. Still, it’s hard to keep a sector leader down — and Apple has repeatedly proven its resilience and ability to continue innovating.
What Comes Next?
Apple is zeroing in on the next phase of AI technology all while the red-hot artificial intelligence market continues to surge. The company’s new M4 chip could signal a turning point for the tech giant and, as more updates on ACDC are released, AAPL stock may rise even further.
All told, Apple is in an excellent position to secure a piece of this lucrative space.

2024-05-07,3 Nasdaq Darlings With Hidden Upside Potential,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
As the stock market starts to pick up where it left off before running into April turbulence, value investors should be willing to give undervalued Nasdaq stocks a look. Some are cheaper after the latest round of earnings season, which was met with mixed results across the board.
In any case, don’t bet against the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 now that it’s regained most of the ground it has lost in an ugly April. As the bull market commences, the following undervalued Nasdaq stocks are worth adding to the watchlist as tech momentum and Fed jitters ease. At the same time, quarterly earnings take a front-row seat.
The following undervalued Nasdaq stocks are among the timelier bets on the market, even if the latest earnings “bump” causes some investors to depart.
Starbucks (SBUX)
Source: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com
It was really hard to get over just how terrible the latest quarterly earnings results were for Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ). The firm lowered full-year sales and earnings expectations while clocking in a sudden drop in profits. It was not only a bad showing by its new CEO, Laxman Narasimhan, but it seems like the Starbucks growth thesis is broken as we know it.
Legendary Starbucks founder and ex-top boss Howard Schultz recently commented on the matter, noting that its locations need a “maniacal focus on the customer experience,” Indeed, it appears Narasimhan has been doing his best to improve things at the store level (he’s taken shifts at Starbucks), but to no avail.
You can’t fault Starbucks entirely for the rough patch, though. The broader quick-serve restaurant scene has been rocked lately, with consumers responding to widespread price increases by putting away their wallets. Starbucks has just felt the industry hit a bit harder.
I think Schultz, a notable “boomerang CEO,” may need to make another return to the helm if Starbucks’ latest crisis worsens. The stock has now shed around 42% of its value from its 2021 highs. That’s some serious underperformance that perhaps only Schultz may know how to solve. Either way, the stock looks super cheap right here.
Adobe (ADBE)
Source: Tattoboo / Shutterstock
Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) seems to be in an enviable position to monetize emerging generative artificial intelligence ( AI ) technologies as it brings its creative suite user base to this new era. That said, the stock hasn’t been booming of late compared to most other companies looking to tap into AI to jolt sales growth. The stock is down 15% year to date, while most other AI stocks have been gaining.
Indeed, it’s hard to be enthused about Adobe’s AI capabilities when incredible AI image generators Midjourney and OpenAI’s Dall-E may find themselves nipping at Adobe’s heels over the coming years. Despite this, I view Adobe as a Nasdaq darling and AI underdog that could have plenty of surprises up its sleeves as it continues rolling out new AI innovations.
More recently, the firm made a big splash in the realm of AI video generation and editing . From text-to-video to AI-assisted video editing in Premier Pro, it’s clear Adobe wants a big piece of the AI creative market.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock recently shocked investors with a historic $110 billion buyback announcement. The big buyback news and some better-than-expected quarterly numbers were enough to propel AAPL stock around 7%.
It will be interesting to see where Apple goes from here as it moves on from its two-year period of relative sluggishness. The stock is currently trading at 28.26 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) — not exactly cheap for a firm that’s run into a bit of a growth slump.
AI rumors could certainly pick up traction as we inch closer to the second half. But could we be looking at a buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news situation regarding AI?
As always, only time will tell. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to value Apple shares here, with Warren Buffett recently announcing that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B ) had slashed its stake by 13%.

“The new iPad Pro with M4 is a great example of how building best-in-class custom silicon enables breakthrough products,” said Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Technologies. “The power-efficient performance of M4, along with its new display engine, makes the thin design and game-changing display of iPad Pro possible, while fundamental improvements to the CPU, GPU, Neural Engine, and memory system make M4 extremely well suited for the latest applications leveraging AI. Altogether, this new chip makes iPad Pro the most powerful device of its kind.”
New Technologies Enabling the New iPad Pro
Delivering a giant leap in performance over the previous iPad Pro with M2, M4 consists of 28 billion transistors built using a second-generation 3-nanometer technology that further advances the power efficiency of Apple silicon. M4 also features an entirely new display engine designed with pioneering technologies, enabling the stunning precision, color accuracy, and brightness uniformity of the Ultra Retina XDR display, a state-of-the-art display created by combining the light of two OLED panels.
New 10-core CPU
M4 has a new up-to-10-core CPU consisting of up to four performance cores and now six efficiency cores. The next-generation cores feature improved branch prediction, with wider decode and execution engines for the performance cores, and a deeper execution engine for the efficiency cores. And both types of cores also feature enhanced, next-generation ML accelerators.
M4 delivers up to 1.5x faster CPU performance over the powerful M2 in the previous iPad Pro. 1 Whether working with complex orchestral music files in Logic Pro® or adding highly demanding effects to 4K video in LumaFusion, M4 boosts performance across pro workflows.
GPU Brings New Capabilities to iPad Pro
The new 10-core GPU of M4 builds upon the next-generation graphics architecture of the M3 family of chips. It features Dynamic Caching, an Apple innovation that allocates local memory dynamically in hardware and in real time to dramatically increase the average utilization of the GPU. This significantly increases performance for the most demanding pro apps and games.
Hardware-accelerated ray tracing comes to iPad for the first time, and enables even more realistic shadows and reflections in games and other graphically rich experiences. Hardware-accelerated mesh shading is also built into the GPU, and delivers greater capability and efficiency in geometry processing, enabling more visually complex scenes in games and graphics-intensive apps. Pro rendering performance in apps like Octane gets a huge boost with M4, and is now up to four times faster than on M2. 1 With these improvements to the CPU and GPU, M4 maintains Apple silicon’s industry-leading performance per watt. M4 can deliver the same performance as M2 using just half the power. And compared with the latest PC chip in a thin and light laptop, M4 can deliver the same performance using just a fourth of the power. 2
The Most Powerful Neural Engine Ever
M4 has a blazing-fast Neural Engine — an IP block in the chip dedicated to the acceleration of AI workloads. This is Apple’s most powerful Neural Engine ever, capable of an astounding 38 trillion operations per second — a breathtaking 60x faster than the first Neural Engine in A11 Bionic. Together with next-generation ML accelerators in the CPU, the high-performance GPU, and higher-bandwidth unified memory, the Neural Engine makes M4 an outrageously powerful chip for AI. And with AI features in iPadOS® like Live Captions for real-time audio captions, and Visual Look Up, which identifies objects in video and photos, the new iPad Pro allows users to accomplish amazing AI tasks quickly and on device.
iPad Pro with M4 can easily isolate a subject from its background throughout a 4K video in Final Cut Pro® with just a tap, and can automatically create musical notation in real time in StaffPad by simply listening to someone play the piano. And inference workloads can be done efficiently and privately while minimizing the impact on app memory, app responsiveness, and battery life. The Neural Engine in M4 is Apple’s most capable yet, and is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC today.
Advanced Media Engine for Smooth, Efficient Streaming
The Media Engine of M4 is the most advanced to come to iPad. In addition to supporting the most popular video codecs, like H.264, HEVC, and ProRes®, it brings hardware acceleration for AV1 to iPad for the first time. This provides more power-efficient playback of high-resolution video experiences from streaming services.
Better for the Environment
The power-efficient performance of M4 helps the all-new iPad Pro meet Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency and deliver all-day battery life. This results in less time needing to be plugged in and less energy consumed over its lifetime.
Today, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations, and by 2030, plans to be carbon neutral across the entire manufacturing supply chain and life cycle of every product.

The all-new Logic Pro for iPad and Mac delivers breakthrough music-making experiences. (Photo: Business Wire)
“Logic Pro gives creatives everything they need to write, produce, and mix a great song, and our latest features take that creativity to a whole new level,” said Brent Chiu-Watson, Apple’s senior director of Apps Worldwide Product Marketing. “Logic Pro’s new AI-backed updates, combined with the unparalleled performance of iPad, Mac, and M-series Apple silicon, provide creative pros with the best music creation experience in the industry.”
Session Players: A Personalized AI-Driven Backing Band
Session Players offer groundbreaking experiences for creators by providing a personal, AI-driven backing band that responds directly to feedback. 1 Drummer took the music creation industry by storm when it debuted as one of the world’s first generative musicians more than a decade ago. Today, it gets even better with key improvements and the addition of a new virtual Bass Player and Keyboard Player. Session Players augment the live-playing experience while ensuring artists maintain full agency during any phase of their music-making process.
Bass Player was trained in collaboration with today’s best bass players using advanced AI and sampling technologies. Users can choose from eight different Bass Players and guide their performance with controls for complexity and intensity, while leveraging advanced parameters for slides, mutes, dead notes, and pickup hits. Bass Player can jam along with chord progressions, or users can choose from 100 Bass Player loops to draw new inspiration. With Chord Track, users can define and edit the chord progressions to a song, and the virtual Bass Player will follow along perfectly. Plus, with Studio Bass plug-in, users gain access to six new, meticulously recorded instruments, from acoustic to electric — all inspired by the sounds of today’s most popular bass tones and genres.
With Keyboard Player, users can choose from four different styles, designed in cooperation with top studio musicians and made to accompany a wide variety of music genres. Keyboard Player can play everything from simple block chords to chord voicing with extended harmony — with nearly endless variations. Like Bass Player, Chord Track adds and edits the chord progression of the song, so Keyboard Player follows along. Using Studio Piano plug-in, users can select additional sound-shaping options, with the ability to adjust three mic positions, pedal noise, key noise, release samples, and sympathetic resonance.
Stem Splitter: Recover Great Recordings
Most musicians perform their best without the pressure of a formal studio session. These moments are often found in Voice Memos recordings, an old demo cassette tape, or are captured from a live show. Listening back, these recordings can reveal magical performances that are nearly impossible to re-create, making them lost to time. Now, with Stem Splitter, an artist can recover moments of inspiration from any audio file and separate nearly any mixed audio recording into four distinct parts: Drums, Bass, Vocals, and Other instruments, right on the device. 2 With these tracks separated, it’s easy to apply effects, add new parts, or change the mix. Powered by AI and M-series Apple silicon, Stem Splitter is lightning fast.

“iPad Pro empowers a broad set of pros and is perfect for anyone who wants the ultimate iPad experience — with its combination of the world’s best displays, extraordinary performance of our latest M-series chips, and advanced accessories — all in a portable design. Today, we’re taking it even further with the new, stunningly thin and light iPad Pro, our biggest update ever to iPad Pro,” said John Ternus, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering. “With the breakthrough Ultra Retina XDR display, the next-level performance of M4, incredible AI capabilities, and support for the all-new Apple Pencil Pro and Magic Keyboard, there’s no device like the new iPad Pro.”
Thinnest Apple Product Ever
The new iPad Pro — the thinnest Apple product ever — features a stunningly thin and light design, taking portability to a whole new level. The 11-inch model is just 5.3 mm thin, and the 13-inch model is even thinner at a striking 5.1 mm, while both models are just as strong as the previous design. The 11-inch model weighs less than a pound, and the 13-inch model is nearly a quarter pound lighter than its predecessor — allowing pro users to extend their workflows in new ways and in more places. The new iPad Pro is available in two gorgeous finishes — silver and space black — both with 100 percent recycled aluminum enclosures.
World’s Most Advanced Display
The new iPad Pro debuts the Ultra Retina XDR, the world’s most advanced display, to provide an even more remarkable visual experience. The Ultra Retina XDR display features state-of-the-art tandem OLED technology that uses two OLED panels and combines the light from both to provide phenomenal full-screen brightness. The new iPad Pro supports an incredible 1000 nits of full-screen brightness for SDR and HDR content, and 1600 nits peak for HDR. No other device of its kind delivers this level of extreme dynamic range. Tandem OLED technology enables sub-millisecond control over the color and luminance of each pixel, taking XDR precision further than ever. Specular highlights in photos and video appear even brighter, and there’s more detail in shadows and low light than ever before on iPad® — all while delivering even more responsiveness to content in motion. For pro users working in high-end, color-managed workflows or challenging lighting conditions, a new nano-texture glass option comes to iPad Pro for the first time. 1 Nano-texture glass is precisely etched at a nanometer scale, maintaining image quality and contrast while scattering ambient light for reduced glare. With its breakthrough tandem OLED technology, extreme brightness, incredibly precise contrast, brilliant colors, and nano-texture glass option, the new Ultra Retina XDR display is the world’s most advanced display, giving iPad Pro customers an unparalleled viewing experience.
Only Possible with M4
The incredibly thin and light design and game-changing display of the new iPad Pro is only possible with M4, the next generation of Apple silicon that delivers a huge leap in performance. M4 is built on second-generation 3-nanometer technology that’s even more power efficient, which is perfect for the design of the new iPad Pro. With an entirely new display engine, M4 introduces pioneering technology for the stunning precision, color, and brightness of the Ultra Retina XDR display. The new CPU offers up to four performance cores and now six efficiency cores, 2 with next-generation machine learning (ML) accelerators, to deliver up to 1.5x faster CPU performance over M2 in the previous-generation iPad Pro. 3 M4 builds on the GPU architecture of M3 — the 10-core GPU includes powerful features like Dynamic Caching, and hardware-accelerated mesh shading and ray tracing, which come to iPad for the first time. Coupled with higher unified memory bandwidth, pro rendering apps like Octane will see up to 4x faster performance than M2. 3 M4 also delivers tremendous gains and industry-leading performance per watt. Compared to M2, M4 can deliver the same performance using just half the power, and compared to the latest PC chip in a thin and light laptop, M4 can deliver the same performance using just a quarter of the power. 4 A new advanced Media Engine includes support for AV1 decode, providing more power-efficient playback of high-resolution video experiences from streaming services.
Outrageously Powerful Device for AI
The new iPad Pro with M4 features Apple’s most powerful Neural Engine ever, capable of 38 trillion operations per second, which is 60x faster than Apple’s first Neural Engine in the A11 Bionic chip. Combined with next-generation ML accelerators in the CPU, a high-performance GPU, more memory bandwidth, and intelligent features and powerful developer frameworks in iPadOS®, the Neural Engine makes the new iPad Pro an outrageously powerful device for AI. With iPad Pro with M4, users can perform AI-enabled tasks even faster, like easily isolate a subject from its background in 4K video with just a tap with Scene Removal Mask in Final Cut Pro®. With this advanced level of performance, the Neural Engine in M4 is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC today.
iPadOS also has advanced frameworks like Core ML® that make it easy for developers to tap into the Neural Engine to deliver phenomenal AI features locally, including running powerful diffusion and generative AI models, with great performance on device. iPad Pro also supports cloud-based solutions, enabling users to run powerful productivity and creative apps that tap into the power of AI, such as Copilot for Microsoft 365 and Adobe Firefly.
Pro Cameras
The updated camera system on the new iPad Pro delivers even more versatility, and with its rich audio from four studio-quality mics, users can shoot, edit, and share all on one device. The 12MP back camera captures vibrant Smart HDR images and video with even better color, improved textures, and detail in low light. It also now features a new adaptive True Tone® flash that makes document scanning on the new iPad Pro better than ever. Using AI, the new iPad Pro automatically identifies documents right in the Camera app, and if a shadow is in the way, it instantly takes multiple photos with the new adaptive flash, stitching the scan together for a dramatically better scan.
On the front, the TrueDepth® camera system moves to the landscape location on the new iPad Pro. The Ultra Wide 12MP camera with Center Stage® makes the experience of video conferencing in landscape orientation even better, especially when iPad is attached to a Magic Keyboard or Smart Folio®.
Pro Connectivity
iPad Pro includes a high-performance USB-C connector with support for Thunderbolt 3 and USB 4, delivering fast wired connectivity — up to 40Gb/s. Thunderbolt supports an extensive ecosystem of high-performance accessories, including external displays like the Pro Display XDR at its full 6K resolution, and external storage, all connected using high-performance cables and docks. iPad Pro supports Wi-Fi 6E for super-fast Wi-Fi connections for pro workflows on the go. Wi-Fi + Cellular models with 5G allow users to access their files, communicate with colleagues, and back up their data in a snap while on the go. Cellular models of the new iPad Pro are activated with eSIM, a more secure alternative to a physical SIM card, allowing users to quickly connect and transfer their existing plans digitally, and store multiple cellular plans on a single device. Customers can easily get connected to wireless data plans on the new iPad Pro in over 190 countries and regions around the world without needing to get a physical SIM card from a local carrier.
Apple Pencil Pro
Apple Pencil Pro features even more magical capabilities and powerful new interactions that take the Apple Pencil® experience even further. A new sensor in the barrel can sense a user’s squeeze, bringing up a tool palette to quickly switch tools, line weights, and colors, all without interrupting the creative process. A custom haptic engine delivers a light tap that provides confirmation when users squeeze, use double-tap, or snap to a Smart Shape for a remarkably intuitive experience. A gyroscope allows users to roll Apple Pencil Pro for precise control of the tool they’re using. Rotating the barrel changes the orientation of shaped pen and brush tools, just like pen and paper. And with Apple Pencil hover, users can visualize the exact orientation of a tool before making a mark.
With these advanced features, Apple Pencil Pro allows users to bring their ideas to life in entirely new ways, and developers can also create their own custom interactions. Apple Pencil Pro brings support for Find My® for the first time to Apple Pencil, helping users locate Apple Pencil Pro if misplaced. It pairs, charges, and is stored on the side of iPad Pro through a new magnetic interface. iPad Pro also supports Apple Pencil (USB-C), ideal for note taking, sketching, annotating, journaling, and more, at an incredible value.
All-New Magic Keyboard and Smart Folio
Designed for the new iPad Pro, an all-new thinner and lighter Magic Keyboard makes it more portable and versatile than ever. The new Magic Keyboard opens to the magical floating design that customers love, and now includes a function row for access to features like screen brightness and volume controls. It also has a gorgeous aluminum palm rest and larger trackpad that’s even more responsive with haptic feedback, so the entire experience feels just like using a MacBook®. The new Magic Keyboard attaches magnetically, and the Smart Connector® immediately connects power and data without the need for Bluetooth. The machined aluminum hinge also includes a USB-C connector for charging. The new Magic Keyboard comes in two colors that perfectly complement the new iPad Pro: black with a space black aluminum palm rest, and white with a silver aluminum palm rest.
The new Smart Folio for iPad Pro attaches magnetically and now supports multiple viewing angles for greater flexibility. Available in black, white, and denim, it complements the colors of the new iPad Pro.
Powerful iPadOS Features
iPadOS is packed with features that push the boundaries of what’s possible on iPad. With Reference Mode, iPadOS can precisely match color requirements of the Ultra Retina XDR display for tasks in which accurate colors and consistent image quality are critical — including review and approve, color grading, and compositing. Stage Manager® enables users to work with multiple overlapping windows in a single view, resize windows, tap to switch between apps, and more. With full external display support of up to 6K, iPad Pro users can also extend their workflow, as well as use the built-in camera on an external display for enhanced video conferencing. Users can take advantage of the powerful AI capabilities in iPad Pro and intelligent features in iPadOS, including Visual Look Up, Subject Lift, Live Text®, or Live Captions and Personal Voice for accessibility.

2024-05-08,1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks Apple Stock Is Going to $210. Is It a Buy Around $182?,"Apple 's (NASDAQ: AAPL) recent streak of revenue declines might soon reverse thanks to a refreshed lineup of products, and the stock is unambiguously a buy. That's the post-earnings take on the company from one analyst following the company. After the May 2 publication of the high-profile tech company's latest quarterly report, he reiterated his bullish view of the stock.
That optimistic analyst is CFRA's Angelo Zino, who pegs Apple as a buy with a price targe t of $210. That implies 15% upside from the stock's current level.
Apple is best known for its products, although it's the company's ever-growing lineup of services that's on the rise. They collectively brought it nearly $24 billion in the tech giant's recently published quarter, which was a 14% improvement year-over-year. Going in the opposite direction, product sales declined by 10% to almost $67 billion.",16
2024-05-08,Apple Has A Cash Problem,"Tim Cook’s firm needs a better long-term growth plan. Investing in AI may be necessary, but it’s also too risky to go full steam ahead.
Apple has grown its services division, but it is still primarily a device company, as Tuesday’s event showed.
Apple has been plowing more cash into products. Research and development spending as a percentage of sales has nearly tripled to 9% over the past 10 years.
By Breakingviews
Apple ( AAPL ) has a cash problem. Not that it is lacking: The $2.8 trillion company produces over $100 billion of excess cash a year. But last week’s reveal that its top line shrank 4% last quarter – and an underwhelming event on Tuesday that launched upgraded iPads and a new Apple Pencil – show the company’s quandary.

2024-05-08,"Apple: According To My Estimates, 72.3M iPhones Will Need To Be Replaced This Year","Q2 2024 earnings report slightly beat expectations, prompting a re-evaluation. Revised fair price estimate is $221.04, suggesting a 20.5% undervaluation.
Apple focuses on innovation and cost-cutting, exemplified by Apple Silicon CPUs. Net income and operating income have been growing faster than revenue.
Smartphone and consumer electronics markets show steady growth, along with potential in accessories and cloud gaming.
Near-term catalyst is device replacement cycles. Despite risks like geopolitical tensions, undervaluation and strong services growth justify a ""strong-buy"" rating.
Thesis
In my previous article on Apple Inc. ( AAPL ), I re-evaluated Apple following its Q1 2024 earnings (which were released on February 1, 2024). The fair price estimate in that article was $276.29, and the future price estimate was $403.14. This prompted an upgrade from ""buy"" to ""strong buy"".
The company released Q2 2024 earnings on May 2 . The company beat EPS and revenue estimates by a slim margin of 0.02% and 2.09% respectively. The company also increased the dividend to $0.25 per share (which is a 4% increase), as well as announced a $110B stock buyback program....",16
2024-05-08,Buffett's Banking Bets: Analyzing the 3 Largest Bank Stocks in Berkshire's Portfolio,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Even before last year’s regional banking crisis, Warren Buffett was bailing on bank stocks . Gone from the portfolio were long-time holdings like Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ), U.S. Bank (NYSE: USB ) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ).
He became disenchanted with the financial institutions and how they operated. He thought they were taking “dumb” risks and were misleading investors by using deceptive accounting tricks to pad their bottom lines. After seeing some red flags in their financial statements, Buffett dumped their shares from Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A )(NYSE: BRK-B ).
The subsequent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank seemed to prove just what Buffett was saying.
And yet Buffett didn’t sell all of his bank stocks. In fact, he owns six bank stocks, a few acquired after he dumped many of the old line banks. For example, Nu Holdings (NASDAQ: NU ), a new-fangled, all-digital Brazilian banking outfit, was bought in 2021. Recently he acquired stock in five Japanese banks , businesses he says he believes their United States counterparts could learn a lot from.
Below are three Warren Buffett bank stocks that comprise the largest holdings in Berkshire Hathaway.
Buffet’s Bank Stocks: Citigroup (C)

Citigroup (NYSE: C ) is performing more like an artificial intelligence stock than a bank stock. Shares of the financial firm are up 63% from the lows hit last October and are running 21% higher in 2024. That vindicates the support Buffett has provided the bank, which assumes almost 1% in his portfolio.
The bank is undergoing a turnaround that is supercharging the stock. It reported first-quarter results last month that were better than Wall street expected. Revenue rose 1% from last year to $21.1 billion, better than analyst expectations of $20.4 billion. Although profits dropped 28% to $1.58 per share, they were much better than the consensus outlook of $1.20 per share. But Citi has now completed its overhaul that sought to significantly reduce costs, in part by effecting dramatic job cuts. It is also selling off over a dozen retail banking businesses.
Banking was Citi’s top-performing segment in the quarter as revenue jumped 49% on the surprising strength of investment banking and corporate lending. The bank’s return on tangible common equity improved dramatically to 9.9% from 1% last year and a negative 6.6% in the fourth quarter.
Buffett owns 55.2 million shares of Citigroup, or 2.9% of the bank’s outstanding shares.
American Express (AXP)
Source: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com
Thought of as mostly as credit card company, American Express (NYSE: AXP ) also offers savings accounts and certificates of deposit online. It also has an online bank called American Express National Bank with savings and checking accounts.
American Express is one of Buffett’s oldest holdings, first acquired back in 1991. Remarkably, he has not bought a single share of AmEx since the late 1990s but time and the effects of compounding allowed it to become the fourth biggest position in Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio. Buffett owns 151.6 million shares of the financial company or 21.1% of the total outstanding shares. With the stake valued at $35.4 billion, American Express occupies nearly 10% of the portfolio’s total.
AmEx also reported better-than-expected results with net interest income (NII), or the amount of money it earns from customers who keep a balance on their accounts, jumping 26% from last year. Not everyone fears the higher interest rates the Federal Reserve is charging. But by also targeting a younger demographic , American Express is enjoying significant growth. Chairman and CEO Stephen Squeri said  millennials and Gen Z consumers “accounted for over 60 percent of new consumer account acquisitions globally.”
Bank of America (BAC)
Source: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.com
The premiere Warren Buffett bank stock is Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ). It was also one of the bank stocks he was buying as the regional banking crisis shook faith in the country’s financial foundations. It took his holdings to over 1 billion shares , or 13.2% of the outstanding total.
At today’s prices, that stake is valued it at $38.8 billion, only surpassed by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) at $144 billion. As it is, the bank represents 10.7% of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio.
The financial giant, one of the biggest banks in the country, has also benefited from high interest rates boosting NII. While it also increased unrealized losses , Bank of America should be able to outlast the storm until those assets come to maturity. The stock market appreciates the stability the bank offers as shares have shot 50% higher from their lows and stand 12% above where they started 2024.
There is no indication Buffett plans to pare his stake in Bank of America as he has been doing with Apple and it will remain a stalwart of Berkshire Hathaway.

2024-05-08,3 Tech Stock Darlings to Scoop Up After Q2 earnings,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Over the past year, advancements in artificial intelligence ( AI ), cloud computing and cybersecurity propelled the tech sector to new Wall Street heights. As a result, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index has returned over 35% in the past 12 months. Now that we are well into the second-quarter earnings season, investors are looking for tech stocks to buy after earnings.
Despite the decline in the tech sector in April, many positive earnings surprises across sectors have led to renewed optimism on Wall Street. And, the “Magnificent Seven” stocks, namely Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) (NASDAQ: GOOG ), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ), are once again on investors’ radars.
Analysts have also been endorsing a number of tech darlings, especially citing AI’s role in the sector’s growth. For instance, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) recently raised Apple’s target price post-earnings , noting the quarterly performance, stock buyback and hints at AI updates to come. With that in mind, let’s explore three tech stocks to to buy after earnings.
Amazon (AMZN)
Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com
The first company is Amazon, which reported impressive Q1 2024 financials on April 30. Revenues surged 13% year-over-year ( YOY ) to $143 billion, driven by strong e-commerce and Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) performance. Net income tripled to $10.4 billion, or 98 cents per diluted share, compared to the same period last year. Additionally, the company’s free cash flow surged to $50 billion. This is a notable improvement from the $3.3 billion outflow in the previous year.
Apart from a strong retail business fueled by robust consumer demand, Amazon’s strategic emphasis on AI infrastructure positions it for further growth. Innovations such as the Trainium and Inferentia chips optimize machine learning tasks, ensuring efficiency. Furthermore, the AI services platform, Bedrock, streamlines deployment and customization . And, third-party applications utilizing Amazon’s infrastructure expand its market presence and reach.
As a result, AMZN stock has gained 22% year-to-date ( YTD ). Meanwhile, the shares are changing hands at 41 times forward earnings and three times trailing sales. Despite the relatively high valuation, analysts foresee further upside. They set a 12-month price target of $220, suggesting an 18% potential increase from current levels. Interested investors may consider the $180 level as a better entry point into Amazon shares.
iShares U.S. Technology ETF (IYW)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices , noted that the information technology and communication services sectors, which comprise the majority of the tech industry, drove over 70% of the S&P 500 ’s total return of 26.3% in 2023. The “Magnificent Seven” played a significant role in this rally, contributing around 60% of the index’s total return.
Therefore, the iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSEARCA: IYW ) stands out as a compelling choice . This ETF provides a gateway to a diverse group of U.S. tech companies, reflecting a blend of established players and innovative disruptors.
Since its inception in May 2000, IYW has demonstrated remarkable growth, now boasting net assets totaling $16 billion. The fund offers a comprehensive portfolio comprising 131 holdings, with the top ten commanding approximately 65% of the allocation.
Among its leading holdings are tech giants Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Alphabet. The fund maintains a diversified spread across sectors, including Software & Services (40%), Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment (30%), Tech Hardware & Equipment (18%) and Media & Entertainment (10%).
IYW is up nearly 8% YTD and has gained almost 44% over the past 12 months, outperforming the broad S&P 500 index as well as the Nasdaq 100 index. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios stand at around 36.5x and 9.5x, respectively. Finally, investors should note IYW’s expense ratio of 0.4%.
Qualcomm (QCOM)
Source: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com
Our final pick among top tech stocks to buy earnings is Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ). The leading global provider of semiconductor solutions and wireless technology operates through Qualcomm CDMA Technologies ( QCT ) and Qualcomm Technology Licensing ( QTL ). QCT generates revenue from chipsets for the telecommunications industry, while QTL manages patent licensing.
Recently, QCOM stock hit an all-time high after releasing impressive second-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings. The company reported $9.4 billion in non-GAAP revenues, a 1% increase from the previous year’s quarter, and $2.44 in diluted earnings per share, a 13% rise YOY that exceeded guidance. Notably, QCT Automotive saw exceptional growth, with a 35% surge in revenues due to expanded content in new vehicle launches featuring Snapdragon Digital Chassis products.
Investors have been following the anticipated demand for AI-equipped premium smartphones. Going forward, the company’s strategic diversification into emerging sectors like automotive, IoT and networking underscores Qualcomm’s commitment to long-term sustainability and revenue diversification.
So far in 2024, QCOM shares have returned 24%, and currently trade at around 19 times forward earnings and six times trailing sales, indicating a relatively premium valuation. Nonetheless, analysts’ price targets of $185 still imply an average upside potential of 3% from current levels. Finally, the stock also offers a 1.9% dividend yield.

2024-05-08,PayPal Stock Analysis: Why PYPL Is Still a Huge Bargain Right Now,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
In a column about PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL ) published on Oct. 19, 2023, I wrote that “PYPL stock trades at bargain-basement levels and has a new, up-and-coming CEO. Additionally, I believe the Street is overly worried about threats to PayPal’s dominance.” And I advised investors to “buy the shares on weakness.”
That turned out to be pretty good advice as shares jumped 20% between Oct. 19 and May 6. Also noteworthy is that, during the same period, the shares of SoFi (NASDAQ: SOFI ), a popular fintech name that I’ve been bearish on, fell 6%. And now, after PayPal reported standout first-quarter results and with its shares still trading at very low valuations, I continue to recommend that growth-at-a-reasonable-price investors buy the shares. Also importantly, the company has multiple, potential and strong positive catalysts.
PayPal’s Strong Q1 Results
The fintech giant’s top line advanced 9.4% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier to $7.7 billion while its total payment volume (TPV) jumped an impressive 14% year-over-year ( YOY ) to $404 billion and its earnings per share rose 27% YOY to $1.08.
The company’s continued strong revenue and TPV growth show that the Street’s worries about the firm losing market share to Apple ‘s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Apple Pay are completely unfounded. And the large increase in its EPS suggests that the cost controls implemented by the firm’s new CEO Alex Chriss are bearing fruit.
Low Valuation + Positive Catalysts = Buy
Despite the recent, strong gains of PayPal stock, the name’s valuation continues to be exceptionally low and attractive.
Indeed, the shares have a forward price-earnings ratio of 15.3x and an enterprise value/EBITDA ratio of 9.2 times. Given PayPal’s rapid revenue growth and the large increase in its profits, I believe that the stock remains extremely undervalued.
On the catalyst front, the firm is testing a new, fast checkout feature. According to Chriss, almost 80% of the consumers who have used the feature in tests utilize PayPal to pay when they check out again. Moreover, the conversion rates of the merchants who use it rise about 10%, the CEO reported.
Given these points, I believe that this offering will significantly increase PayPal’s payment volumes while enabling it to convince more vendors to utilize its platform.
Chriss also indicated that the firm is working harder than under his predecessor to market its fraud-prevention solution. Finally, PayPal has been convincing more small and medium businesses to use its Complete Payments suite. The CEO indicated that the companies that utilize this offering use more of PayPal’s products.
Finally, Chriss suggested that he would meaningfully increase the company’s low prices going forward.
Over the longer term, I expect these initiatives, taken together, to enable the growth of PayPal’s top and bottom lines to meaningfully accelerate.
Plenty of runway for growth
There are other indications besides the low valuation of the shares which suggest that the name can advance a great deal.
First,the average price target of Street analysts on the stock is $71.48, meaningfully above its current price of around $65. Second, out of 35 analysts who cover the name, only 15 of them have “buy” ratings on the shares. As more of these analysts “see the light” and upgrade the shares, they are likely to rise meaningfully.
Finally, the shares have a low Relative Strength rating of 48 and an average Accumulation/Distribution rating of C, according to Investor’s Business Daily . These metrics indicate that the stock has underperformed in the last year, while institutions have not bought a great deal of its in the last 13 weeks. As many more investors realize that PayPal stock is a bargain ,the shares should rally a great deal.

2024-05-08,Which Credit Bureau Stock Should You Buy for the Long-Term?,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
When you write about the markets as much as I do, finding subjects to cover is challenging. A recent New York Times article about “Pay Later” lenders gave me an idea about credit bureau stocks to buy.
The Times article discussed how credit bureaus want to start including “buy now, pay later” purchases on consumer credit reports and credit scores.
This was prompted by Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) February move to start reporting loans made through its Apple Pay Later service to Experian (OTCMKTS: EXPGY ), one of the three main credit bureaus.
A major issue with not reporting the loans is that it creates what experts call “phantom debt.” The credit bureaus argue that by including them, consumers are building credit. Pay-later lenders argue that each purchase makes a separate loan, hurting a consumer’s credit score.
Ultimately, the Times article concluded that pay-later firms will either be forced by regulators to report pay-later loans or market forces, such as loan delinquencies, will get them to act.
Either way, the three credit bureaus —Experian, TransUnion (NYSE: TRU ), and Equifax (NYSE: EFX )—should remain integral to the lending industry.
One’s a Buy, one’s a Hold, and one’s a Sell.
Experian (EXPGY)
Source: ©iStock.com/ebstock
Seventeen analysts cover Experian. Of those, 14 rate it a Buy, with a $44.94 target price, about 9% higher than its current share price. Of the three stocks, Experian has the highest approval rating from analysts.
Experian’s investor relations website cites five reasons why you should invest in the company: 1) It’s a market leader, 2) it has a purpose-driven growth strategy, 3) it has a sustainable focus and strong commitment to ESG, 4) it is financially sound, and 5) it has a rock-solid foundation for growth.
That’s corporate speak, for it’s one heck of a company.
In its latest presentation, the company points out that its 2023 revenue of $6.62 billion was higher than Equifax ($5.12 billion) and TransUnion ($3.71 billion). Further, it has the most globally diverse revenue, with 33% outside North America compared to 22% and 20% for the other two, respectively.
The company estimates its global addressable market opportunity is $150 billion annually. That’s a double-edged sword. On the one hand, there’s tremendous growth potential. On the other hand, it’s not going to be easy or cheap to grab a bigger piece of the pie.
When in doubt, I look to free cash flow to decide if a company has what it takes for the long haul. In 2023, it was $1.11 billion , down from $1.31 billion a year earlier. Based on an enterprise value of $41.34 billion , it has a free cash flow yield of 2.7%. Anything under 4% is overvalued.
Experian is a Buy.
TransUnion (TRU)
Source: Shutterstock
TransUnion is covered by 20 analysts . Of those, 16 rate it a Buy, with a $90.00 target price, about 14% higher than its current share price.
As I wrote in the previous section, TransUnion has the lowest annual revenue of the three credit bureaus. However, it’s nearly doubled since hitting a 52-week low of $42.09 in November 2023. Here’s why.
In Q1 2024, TransUnion delivered $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time in its history, up 8%, excluding currency, to $1.02 billion. Every region experienced a year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, its adjusted net income for the quarter was $179 million, 16% higher than Q1 2023.
“We are raising our 2024 guidance following first quarter outperformance and now expect to deliver 5 to 6.5 percent revenue growth for the year. We remain focused on driving strong results in a low-growth market environment, with no assumed in-year benefits from interest rate cuts,” stated CEO Chris Cartwright in its Q1 2024 press release.
In 2023, TransUnion’s free cash flow was $334.70 million . Based on an enterprise value of $20.08 billion , it has a free cash flow yield of 1.7%. Anything under 4% is overvalued.
TransUnion is a Hold.

Equifax is covered by 23 analysts . Of those, 18 rate it a Buy, with a $267.30 target price, about 16% higher than its current share price.
Over the past year, Equifax stock has increased 15%, less than TransUnion, which has increased 21%, or Experian, which has increased 21.5%. That’s the bad news. The good news is that Equifax has significantly outperformed its two competitors over the past five years.
Equifax was founded in Atlanta in 1899 as Retail Credit Company . It changed its name to Equifax in 1975 .
Equifax reported its Q1 2024 results in mid-April. Revenues, excluding currency, increased by 8% to $1.39 billion, while its net income rose 11% to $124.9 million. For all of 2024, it expects revenue of $5.72 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, 8.5% higher than 2023, with adjusted earnings per share of $7.35, 9.5% higher than a year ago .
In 2023, Equifax’s free cash flow was $515.5 million [operating cash flow of $1.12 billion less $601.3 million in capital expenditures], up considerably from 2023. Based on an enterprise value of $33.64 billion , it has a free cash flow yield of 1.5%. Anything under 4% is overvalued.
Equifax is a Sell.

With iPhone sales declining and Apple facing intense competition, it's fair to consider if it is best to stop viewing Apple as a growth stock and reclassify it as a premium dividend-paying, blue-chip company. Let's find out if that reclassification would make Apple overvalued relative to other opportunities.

2024-05-07,"Forget the ""Magnificent Seven"": 1 TSX Tech Stock to Buy Instead","The ‘Magnificent Seven’ have certainly proven to be quite magnificent over the last few years. These companies include Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG )( NASDAQ:GOOGL ), Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ), Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), Meta ( NASDAQ:META ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) and Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ). In fact, the seven largest stocks by market cap on the S&P 500 were pretty much holding up the index, taking up about 30% of the overall index.
So while it looked like the S&P 500 was doing really well, it really came down to these absolutely enormous companies. And that led many investors to have a few worries. So let’s get into what those worries were, and why there’s another TSX tech stock to consider instead.
Worry flurry
The fear was that with the S&P 500 running higher and higher due to the heavy investment in these seven companies, should the companies drop the market could crash. And while that didn’t exactly happen, there was proof of the hypothesis on the markets.
The ‘Magnificent Seven’ reported their earnings near the beginning of 2024, and each did quite well overall. This led to a surge in the S&P 500, with shares continuing to rise higher and higher between January and the end of March.
However, by the time earnings started to come forward once more, and there was still no drop in interest rates, investors began to fear the positivity would’t continue. This led to a drop in the S&P 500, with investments in major companies like Nvidia stock seeing a massive drop in share price.
Consider sectors
That’s why the historically safe S&P 500 hasn’t been all that safe recently. Until there is more exposure to other companies and areas of the market, I would instead consider diversifying. And that should mean looking at strong sectors that are due to continue rising.
One area is the market of semiconductors . As mentioned, shares of Nvidia stock rose higher as the company not only demonstrated its worth in current earnings, but expects even more in the future.
Yet shares of Nvidia stock are now quite expensive. With that in mind, I would instead look at companies that are involved in the semiconductor process. And Celestica ( TSX:CLS ) is perhaps the best option on the TSX today.
Why Celestica stock?
There are many reasons to consider Celestica stock on the TSX today, especially if you’re looking to invest in semiconductors stocks. Celestica stock operates in the semiconductor industry as a provider of manufacturing services and solutions for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Investing in Celestica can provide diversification within the semiconductor sector, as it offers exposure to semiconductor-related activities beyond semiconductor manufacturing itself.
Furthermore, Celestica offers a range of supply chain services, including design, engineering, manufacturing, and aftermarket services. This diversification of services can mitigate some of the risks associated with pure-play semiconductor companies that may be more exposed to fluctuations in chip demand or pricing.
The company has proven its worth as well, seeing shares surge by 303% in the last year alone! And yet as of writing, shares are below 52-week highs. Therefore, it’s a great time for investors to consider picking up Celestica stock on the TSX today. Especially if they want to get away from the over-exposure of the “Magnificent Seven” stocks.

2024-05-07,New Apple M4 Chip Threatens to Dethrone Nvidia (NVDA) Stock,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
One tech leader is gearing up to challenge Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) as a powerful new rival. Indeed, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) reportedly wants to produce its own chips for artificial intelligence ( AI ) software in data centers. According to The Wall Street Journal , the company has been working on this device — internally codenamed Project ACDC (Apple Chips in Data Center) — for years.
Apple hasn’t officially commented on this server project yet. But it recently reminded investors that it’s taking major steps toward cementing its place in the AI race. Today, the tech firm also announced that its M4 system on a chip (SoC) will power the new iPad Pro. AAPL stock closed the day in the green amid growing enthusiasm for the Silicon Valley darling.
Of course, this is good news for Apple. But if the company’s foray into AI and chips continues, Nvidia may finally have an opponent to seriously threaten its market share.
AAPL Stock in the Age of the M4 Chip
Tech enthusiasts would likely have lined up for the new iPad Pro no matter what. But with the added incentive of a powerful new chip helping usher in a new stage of the AI revolution, interest in this sleek new device will be even higher. With that in mind, it’s easy to see why AAPL stock surged today and NVDA stock dipped, as the threat of a dangerous new competitor may be beginning to loom.
What makes the M4 chip special? Apple provided an in-depth overview of why this innovation matters for both investors and consumers:
“[The] M4 has Apple’s fastest Neural Engine ever, capable of up to 38 trillion operations per second, which is faster than the neural processing unit of any AI PC today. Combined with faster memory bandwidth, along with next-generation machine learning ( ML ) accelerators in the CPU, and a high-performance GPU, M4 makes the new iPad Pro an outrageously powerful device for artificial intelligence.”
This catalyst is likely exactly what Apple needs to bolster to its place as a pillar of Silicon Valley. Despite some recent momentum, AAPL stock remains in the red so far this year and some experts have expressed concern . One analyst at Barclays recently reiterated a “sell” rating on AAPL stock. Still, it’s hard to keep a sector leader down — and Apple has repeatedly proven its resilience and ability to continue innovating.
What Comes Next?
Apple is zeroing in on the next phase of AI technology all while the red-hot artificial intelligence market continues to surge. The company’s new M4 chip could signal a turning point for the tech giant and, as more updates on ACDC are released, AAPL stock may rise even further.
All told, Apple is in an excellent position to secure a piece of this lucrative space.

It’s the first time the multinational has launched new versions of iPad since October 2022. According to CEO Tim Cook:

Apple AI chip is different from Nvidia’s
Note that working on an AI chip does not put Apple in direct competition with Nvidia per se.
That’s because the product it is developing is supposed to be used for “inference” while those of Nvidia are primarily used for “training”. Still, the Mad Money host said on CNBC’s “ Squawk on the Street ”:
This is a very good sign because it’s the beginning of what I regard as the Apple offense on AI. You’re starting to think maybe it deserves a 25 or 26 multiple.

As the stock market starts to pick up where it left off before running into April turbulence, value investors should be willing to give undervalued Nasdaq stocks a look. Some are cheaper after the latest round of earnings season, which was met with mixed results across the board.
In any case, don’t bet against the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 now that it’s regained most of the ground it has lost in an ugly April. As the bull market commences, the following undervalued Nasdaq stocks are worth adding to the watchlist as tech momentum and Fed jitters ease. At the same time, quarterly earnings take a front-row seat.
The following undervalued Nasdaq stocks are among the timelier bets on the market, even if the latest earnings “bump” causes some investors to depart.
Starbucks (SBUX)
Source: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com
It was really hard to get over just how terrible the latest quarterly earnings results were for Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ). The firm lowered full-year sales and earnings expectations while clocking in a sudden drop in profits. It was not only a bad showing by its new CEO, Laxman Narasimhan, but it seems like the Starbucks growth thesis is broken as we know it.
Legendary Starbucks founder and ex-top boss Howard Schultz recently commented on the matter, noting that its locations need a “maniacal focus on the customer experience,” Indeed, it appears Narasimhan has been doing his best to improve things at the store level (he’s taken shifts at Starbucks), but to no avail.
You can’t fault Starbucks entirely for the rough patch, though. The broader quick-serve restaurant scene has been rocked lately, with consumers responding to widespread price increases by putting away their wallets. Starbucks has just felt the industry hit a bit harder.
I think Schultz, a notable “boomerang CEO,” may need to make another return to the helm if Starbucks’ latest crisis worsens. The stock has now shed around 42% of its value from its 2021 highs. That’s some serious underperformance that perhaps only Schultz may know how to solve. Either way, the stock looks super cheap right here.
Adobe (ADBE)
Source: Tattoboo / Shutterstock
Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) seems to be in an enviable position to monetize emerging generative artificial intelligence ( AI ) technologies as it brings its creative suite user base to this new era. That said, the stock hasn’t been booming of late compared to most other companies looking to tap into AI to jolt sales growth. The stock is down 15% year to date, while most other AI stocks have been gaining.
Indeed, it’s hard to be enthused about Adobe’s AI capabilities when incredible AI image generators Midjourney and OpenAI’s Dall-E may find themselves nipping at Adobe’s heels over the coming years. Despite this, I view Adobe as a Nasdaq darling and AI underdog that could have plenty of surprises up its sleeves as it continues rolling out new AI innovations.
More recently, the firm made a big splash in the realm of AI video generation and editing . From text-to-video to AI-assisted video editing in Premier Pro, it’s clear Adobe wants a big piece of the AI creative market.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock recently shocked investors with a historic $110 billion buyback announcement. The big buyback news and some better-than-expected quarterly numbers were enough to propel AAPL stock around 7%.
It will be interesting to see where Apple goes from here as it moves on from its two-year period of relative sluggishness. The stock is currently trading at 28.26 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) — not exactly cheap for a firm that’s run into a bit of a growth slump.
AI rumors could certainly pick up traction as we inch closer to the second half. But could we be looking at a buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news situation regarding AI?
As always, only time will tell. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to value Apple shares here, with Warren Buffett recently announcing that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B ) had slashed its stake by 13%.

The Services segment continues to report growing revenues - doubled from FY2019 levels, on top of the expanding gross profit margins, naturally triggering bottom-line tailwinds.
With much of AAPL's cash returned to long-term shareholders through raised dividends and upsized share repurchase programs, the stock may continue enjoying bullish support ahead.

Apple ( AAPL ) finds itself amidst intense debates after over a year and a half of lagging performance compared to both other big tech giants and the broader S&P 500 Index ( SPY ).

As skepticism mounts, discussions regarding AAPL's future trajectory have intensified, with divergent opinions emerging.
Some investors maintain a strong confidence in AAPL's resilience, citing its formidable market position and robust ecosystem.

2024-05-06,Stocks to Sell: 3 Wall Street Darlings About to Become Investor Nightmares,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Recent first-quarter earnings reports have underlined the level of uncertainty surrounding tech stocks at a time when confounding Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) inflation figures have had an adverse impact on Wall Street.
The news of March inflation data being hotter than expected at 3.5% caused widespread concern across U.S. markets. And the prospect of multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts arriving in 2024 are diminishing as a result.
Markets had largely priced in rate cuts arriving as early as March 2024 earlier this year. So, it’s unsurprising that the S&P 500 fell nearly 4% in April off the back of bad news.
Also, this poses fresh challenges for some key members of Wall Street’s Magnificent Seven. These tech stocks have been major beneficiaries of positive market sentiment. Now, as optimism recedes, we’re seeing more frailties emerge. As a result, these three U.S. bets could be moving into sell territory.
Apple (AAPL)

With a market capitalization of over $2.5 trillion, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has long enjoyed an extensive market share. They’ve had higher profit margins due to the company’s commitment to innovation and high-spec technology.
However, storm clouds appear to be circling for the Wall Street giant. In January, the stock was downgraded by Barclays . This was due to weaker performance in China and a lack of iPhone innovation in recent years.
The stock has since declined more than 8% since the beginning of the year. And, the recent news that Q1 sales in China, the world’s biggest market, have fallen 20% as the same period last year, likely raises concern.
In addition, rival smartphone firm Huawei’s profits have recently risen six-fold . It seems the company found a way to eat into Apple’s market share despite Western sanctions.
All of this has left Apple looking for new opportunities to out-innovate rivals. True, the launch of the Vision Pro has opened the company up to a new market. But Apple’s slower adoption of generative artificial intelligence ( AI ) hurt the short-term recovery of the stock.
As a result, AAPL’s mounting challenges could ultimately damage the stock’s status as a Wall Street darling. Thus, the company must find a fresh avenue for tangible innovation.
Tesla (TSLA)
Source: kovop / Shutterstock.com
Another stock that’s struggling for momentum in 2024 is Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ). The company has already endured a downgrade from Phillip Securities in Q2 from neutral to reduce. It suffers a lowly price target of $145 due to slower electric vehicle ( EV ) deliveries and pricing pressures.
Also, TSLA fell over 25% this year, with first-quarter adjusted profit down 48% and revenue declining 9% compared to Q1 of 2023.
With a price war raging among EV manufacturers in China, there’s a danger that Tesla will become collateral damage. Firms are bidding to secure higher sales volumes throughout global markets.
Then, of course, we can’t overlook the tumultuous leadership of Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) Elon Musk. Recently, he fired Tesla’s entire team of 500 employees behind the firm’s supercharger network. However, it’s important to note that Musk’s idiosyncratic approach to managing the company has contributed to its recent struggles as well as its impressive rally toward becoming one of Wall Street’s most valuable stocks.
Additionally, it’s a testament to Musk’s leadership that the stock has recently experienced some growth. That followed a reported deal to roll out Tesla’s self-driving technology in China. It was described as a “watershed moment” by Wedbush analyst Dan Ives .
Thus, Tesla is a largely unpredictable stock at this moment in time, and for risk-averse investors, it is certainly a sell as the company tries to stop its long-term slide.
Meta Platforms (META)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
Unlike the other stocks, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) is enjoying a strong start to 2024, growing more than 40% in the first quarter alone. However, the tech giant may face future problems stemming from its significant bet on the AI boom.
Notably, AI and generative AI in particular have been big business over the past year. Meta Platforms raised its outlook for total expenses for 2024 to $96-$99 billion which represent a major outlay.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been a longtime cheerleader for AI. And while the company has managed to grow alongside the wider generative AI boom, the industry has remained largely speculative. Therefore, Meta’s heavy spending could represent a gamble for the company if other revenue streams decline.
The firm has experienced slower ad sales to Chinese advertisers , which was previously responsible for five percentage points of Meta’s growth in 2023. This points to a possible struggle to sustain momentum should its AI investments fail to pay off in the long-term.

2024-05-06,Baidu Stock Analysis: It's Surprisingly Cheap to Bet on China's ChatGPT,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ) is more than just a search-engine provider. Indeed, with Baidu stock, you’ll get to participate in China’s counterpart to OpenAI’s artificial intelligence chatbot, ChatGPT.
Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) made a brilliant move when it invested in OpenAI’s ChatGPT technology. In 2024, there are other popular generative AI chatbots besides ChatGPT. I encourage you to invest in Baidu.
Baidu Isn’t Just China’s Google
It’s easy to pigeonhole Baidu as the Chinese version of Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google search engine. And I’ll admit, just as Google is Alphabet’s bread and butter, Baidu generates significant revenue from its popular search engine.
Yet, it’s not fair to pigeonhole Baidu in this way. For example, Baidu launched the first 24/7 robo-taxi service in China. Also, Baidu is an important AI-technology develop.
In fact, per The Wall Street Journal , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) “ held preliminary talks with” Baidu about the possibility of using Baidu’s generative-AI technology in Apple’s devices in China.
Furthermore, Baidu recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Nissan Motor (OTCMKTS: NSANY ) to conduct research on AI and “smart cars.” Not only that, but the agreement calls for Nissan to “equip its Chinese cars with Baidu’s AI products,” Reuters reported.
Baidu’s AI Chatbot Achieves a Milestone
Clearly, Baidu is making its presence known as an AI-tech contender. Investors should keep an eye out for more partnerships, as the Baidu-Nissan MOU might only be the start of an ongoing trend.
Additionally, Baidu is quickly staking its claim as a gen-AI juggernaut in the company’s home country. U.S.-based stock traders might not be aware of this, but Baidu’s ERNIE Bot gen-AI chatbot is gaining serious traction in China.
Recently, Baidu achieves a major milestone when its ERNIE Bot “amassed 200 million users .” That’s what I would call ultra-rapid growth, as ERNIE Bot debuted on March 16, 2023.
This is a perfect example of why U.S. investors should broaden their horizons. ERNIE Bot has a huge presence in China, just like ChatGPT does in America.
Thus, investigating investment opportunities abroad can alert you to new and interesting stock ideas.
Baidu Stock: Grab This While It’s Still Cheap
Are you seeking prime gen-AI exposure in your portfolio, but at a great price? Look no further.
Baidu’s GAAP trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is 12.94x , versus the sector median P/E ratio of 18.98x. Hence, there’s a terrific bargain that’s ripe for the picking.
It’s a shame that some American investors won’t take advantage of this. Maybe they’ve unfairly pigeonholed Baidu or they’re just not aware of the company.
So, feel free to grab some Baidu stock shares while they’re still cheap, as they’ll probably be much more expensive in a year or two.

Does the company’s buyback announcement portend a lack of reinvestment opportunities for the core business? Probably not.
However, Apple's AI announcement this coming week has to get the attention of the Street.
Will AI's capex surge reduce technology stock valuations? The mega cap 7 or mega cap 10 stocks could trade listlessly for a few quarters as the true ""capex"" is worked out.
Capex: FASB - the Financial Accounting Standards Board - defines “capex” as “the investment required to sustain the economics of a business”. Capex is not an expense, i.e., a deduction from revenue, but rather is a “capitalized” item that shows up on the statement of cash flow in the “investing” section, and before the 1980s services economy exploded, was traditionally “payments for property, plant and equipment” that weren’t expensed, but capitalized, and then depreciated over the useful life of an asset.

2024-05-06,Where Will Apple Stock Be in 1 Year?,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) posted its latest earnings report on May 2. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on March 31), the tech giant's revenue fell 4% year over year to $90.8 billion but exceeded analysts' estimates by $190 million. Net income dipped 2% to $23.6 billion, but the company's $43.3 billion in buybacks boosted its diluted EPS by a penny to $1.53 and cleared the consensus forecast by $0.03.
Apple's growth rates were anemic, but it boosted its quarterly dividend by 4% to $0.25 a share, which translates to a forward yield of 0.5%; and authorized a new $110 billion buyback plan, which is equivalent to 4% of its market cap.

2024-05-06,Time to Sell These 3 Under-Performing Stocks Based on Their Bad Decisions,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Sometimes great companies fail to respond effectively to huge, new threats because they’re stuck in a rut and become stocks to sell. The classic example of this phenomenon is Blockbuster’s failure to acquire Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) when it had a golden opportunity to easily do so. For the readers who are too young to remember Blockbuster and haven’t heard about it, the company relied on renting DVDs through brick-and-mortar stores. In 2000, money-losing Netflix was renting DVDs through the mail and, I believe, had the vision of one day streaming movies. In that year, Netflix offered to sell itself to Blockbuster for just $50 million, and Blockbuster refused the offer.
Obviously, Blockbuster’s decision to simply stay the course in the face of huge technological changes proved to be disastrous. The chain subsequently declared bankruptcy and ceased to exist. Here are three contemporary firms that, like Blockbuster, are failing to react effectively to gigantic, looming problems. As a result, I view these names as stocks to sell.
Starbucks (SBUX)
Source: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com
Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) is facing huge competition in China and the U.S. from coffee brands Luckin Coffee (OTCMKTS: LKNCY ) and Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS ). I believe that the key factor behind Starbucks’ recently reported disastrous fiscal second-quarter results was the tough competition from these two rapidly growing firms.
In my opinion, Starbucks made a crucial error by failing to acquire Luckin and/or Dutch Bros when they were trading at much lower levels. If Starbucks had offered to buy them in 2022, for example, the coffee giant could have obtained them for a relatively small sum.
As long as Dutch Bros and Luckin continue to expand and gain market share, I believe that Starbucks will be, at best, “dead money” going forward. Consequently, it’s definitely among stocks to sell.
Walt Disney (DIS)
Source: chrisdorney / Shutterstock
For many years, I’ve believed that Walt Disney’s (NYSE: DIS ) two largest businesses, cable TV channels and movies, were going to shrink dramatically. And, so far, my thesis has certainly proven to be accurate. Cord cutting is continuously reducing cable subscriber totals and Americans are visiting movie theaters much less than they once did. There is also significant competition in the streaming sector. As a result, I thought that Disney’s streaming services would not be a good way to compensate for the declining profits of its cable channel and movie businesses. The latter theory has also proved to be on target, as the conglomerate’s streaming channels still aren’t profitable.
Disney’s decision to put so many of its eggs in the streaming basket was certainly erroneous, as was its decision to spend a huge $71.3 billion on buying 21st Century Fox. By that year, Disney should have seen that its movie and cable assets were headed for big problems.
Instead, Disney should have doubled down on its highly successful parks business by building and/or acquiring parks in additional countries. Buying an online sports betting company company and trying to promote it through ESPN also would have made sense.
The conglomerate very belatedly took a tentative step in that direction by launching a sports-betting partnership with Penn Entertainment (NASDAQ: PENN ) last year. But Disney is not going to directly obtain revenue from the deal. Moreover, the companies’ venture, called, ESPN Bet has a huge disadvantage because it was launched so many years after other companies in the space had already acquired a high number of customers.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com
Last quarter, Apple’s top line dropped a dismal 4.3% versus the same period a year earlier to $90.75 billion. Even more importantly, last quarter was the fifth out of the last six quarters that the storied company’s revenue has fallen. Moreover, the sales generated by the tech giant’s flagship products tumbled a huge 10.5% YOY last quarter.
The firm is supposed to enhance the iPhone with AI capabilities later this year. But, given the company’s inability under CEO Tim Cook to introduce truly needle-moving product initiatives, I don’t expect the changes to boost the iPhone’s sales significantly, let alone meaningfully increase the company’s overall top line.
Apple could have and should have acquired Roku (NASDDAQ: ROKU ). If the tech giant had advertised Apple TV on the platform, its streaming initiative would have become a big success. And it would have been able to tout its many other products on Roku, which could have significantly lifted sales of these other offerings.

2024-05-06,Even Worse than Gamestop? 3 Meme Stocks That Are Screaming Sells,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
You’ll get no argument from me that GameStop (NYSE: GME ) is one of the best meme stocks to sell. However, the video game retailer has been around a long time, suggesting it’s not the worst of the meme stocks to sell.
So who is?
QuiverQuant.com provides data on the top meme stocks in U.S. stock exchanges. One of its data points is the WallStreetBets score , based on the number of times a company is mentioned on the subreddit over the past week.
GameStop has a 95 rating out of 100, which is quite high. Eight others have scores higher than 95. Those would be good candidates for meme stocks to sell.
There are other stocks with lower scores that I would sell in a heartbeat, such as AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC ), which clocks in at 94. I won’t select it because I’m tired of getting emails from AMC bulls complaining about my lack of objectivity. Crap is crap.
Anyway, this list of top meme stocks includes some names worth owning. I’ll save these for another time.
ImmunityBio (IBRX)
Source: everything possible / Shutterstock.com
ImmunityBio (NASDAQ: IBRX ) has a WallStreetBets score of 97, which means it gets a lot of chatter. Many investors may not be familiar with it, but it has a $6.1 billion market capitalization.
“ImmunityBio is a vertically integrated biotechnology company developing next-generation therapies and vaccines that bolster the natural immune system to defeat cancers and infectious diseases,” states the company’s investor relations site,” the company’s investor relations site states .
Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong founded ImmunityBio in 2014 . He is the Executive Chairman and owns nearly 83% of the company through various affiliated businesses. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, he’s worth $12.6 billion , up $2.1 billion in 2024.
If he’s as good at running a biotech firm as a newspaper — he bought the Los Angeles Times in 2018 for $500 million — you don’t want anything to do with ImmunityBio.
One benefit of owning the largest paper on the West Coast is that it gets to announce ImmunityBio news. On April 22, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved Antika, the company’s treatment for bladder cancer. As a result, Antika’s shares are up 70% over the past month.
While good news, it will have to sell a lot of Antika to eliminate the nearly $3 billion accumulated deficit on its balance sheet.
MicroStrategy (MSTR)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR ) has a WallStreetBets score of 96.
There was a time when I thought Chairman and co-founder Michael Saylor’s strategy of buying Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) for his data analytics software business’s balance sheet wasn’t a terrible idea.
When Saylor started buying BTC in August 2020, the Federal Reserve’s Federal Funds Effective Rate, or FRED, was 0.10% . Today, it’s 5.33%. With cash balances delivering negligible income, it couldn’t hurt to put excess cash into an appreciating asset. Bitcoin at the time was $11,670 . Today, it’s over $58,000.
The company reported its Q1 2024 results on April 29. They missed on both the top and bottom lines. Its shares fell nearly 10% on the news.
In February, I argued that MicroStrategy wasn’t a good data analytics stock because Bitcoin obscured its operating business, which isn’t a high-growth enterprise. Its software-related revenue fell 5.5% in the first quarter to $115.2 million.
The problem is that it went from an operating loss of $20.3 million in Q1 2023 to a $203.7 million loss in the latest quarter. This was because of Bitcoin losses in the three months ended March 31, 2024.
Unlike Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B ), which provides investors with a lower-risk way of owning Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), MicroStrategy does not do the same for Bitcoin.
If you want to own the cryptocurrency, buy it directly or purchase one of the many Bitcoin trusts.
Rumble (RUM)
Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com
Rumble (NASDAQ: RMBL ) has a WallStreetBets score of 63, well below GameStop’s 95 score. I picked Rumble because it’s another example of misguided loyalty to all things Donald Trump.
The good news if you bought RUM stock at the beginning of the year is that you’re up more than 55% year-to-date. The bad news is this is about as good as it will get. The stock got as high as $18.52 in February 2022. It remains well down from its 2022 highs despite this year’s gains.
The gains in 2024 are two-fold: First, the same people gobbling up Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ: DJT ) stock also buy Rumble because of its video partnership with Truth Social, TMTG’s social media platform. Secondly, it signed a partnership with Barstool Sports that puts all of Barstool Sports’ content on the Rumble platform.
“I’m excited about Rumble’s commitment to sports and broadening audiences,” said Dave Portnoy, Founder of Barstool Sports. “With the power of Barstool Sports, we are going to help Rumble be the top player in the video, cloud, and livestreaming space.”
It all sounds terrific. Unfortunately, it doesn’t pay the bills.
In 2023, Rumble generated $81 million , which is a heck of a lot more than Trump Media, but it was flat quarter to quarter while losing nearly $136 million in the past year, or $1.68 per dollar of sales, up from 91 cents per dollar of sales in 2022.
Don’t waste your money.

Editor’s Note: This article was previously published under the title, “How to Profit From Elon Musk’s $18 Billion AI Project” but has been updated to include the most recent information.
The global AI Race has begun, and it’s off to a red-hot start. Companies like Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ) and Apple ( AAPL ) – among countless others – are all pouring billions of dollars into this groundbreaking tech.
Why? Because they know that the winner of the AI Race will inevitably become the world’s most powerful company.
But funnily enough, the ultimate winner may not be any of those Big Tech companies.
Rather, it may be a company that you’ve likely never heard of before…
I’m talking about xAI, Elon Musk’s newest AI startup.
A New AI Frontrunner?
About a year ago, Elon Musk set out to create his own AI startup, xAI. He felt that his competitors were all missing the ultimate goal of creating powerful and fair AI. Now, just over a year later, that startup is working to raise $3 billion at an $18 billion valuation.
That is huge growth for a company in just under a year.
But xAI’s growth story could just be getting started.
After all, Apple didn’t become Apple because of the iPhone. It became Apple because of Steve Jobs.
Microsoft didn’t become Microsoft because of Windows. It became Microsoft because of Bill Gates.
World-changing people create world-changing businesses.
So… if you want to invest in world-changing businesses… start by investing in world-changing people.
We certainly believe that Elon Musk is a world-changer.
He co-founded PayPal ( PYPL ), the world’s largest digital payment platform, now worth more than $70 billion…
And SpaceX , the world’s largest private space rocket firm, now worth $180 billion.
He pioneered the world’s largest automaker in Tesla ( TSLA ), which is now worth more than all of the next 10 biggest automakers combined…
And he’s also the man behind Neuralink , The Boring Company , and X .
Musk has influenced how we pay for things, what cars we drive, how we communicate online, how we see space…
I’d venture to say that he is one of the most influential business figures of the past 20 years.
A great example of world-changing.
The Final Word
And now this world-changing person has turned his focus to a new business venture at the heart of possibly the most transformative technology the world has ever seen: AI.
Would you bet against him here?
I don’t think I would.
xAI has already launched an impressive AI chatbot named Grok, which many experts claim stacks up pound-for-pound against ChatGPT. And as we mentioned above, the firm is already in talks to raise $3 billion at an $18 billion valuation.
This latest startup is moving fast. With impressive progress. And the journey is likely just getting started.
Because xAI could be Musk’s biggest venture yet.
And right now, you have an opportunity to invest in it.
Now, not directly, of course – xAI is barely a year old. It is still a private startup.
But we have found a potentially huge “backdoor” investment opportunity into xAI. It’s a stock that you’ve likely have never heard of before, but we think it could be xAI’s leading tech component supplier.
If xAI becomes a champion of the multi-trillion-dollar AI race, then this stock could absolutely soar.
Get all the details about this little-known supplier.

2024-05-06,Apple: Those Who Harp On iPhone Sales Miss The Point,"Those who focus on decelerating iPhone sales have missed the point indeed, since the smart devices are a means to an end - attracting users to its highly sticky ecosystem.
AAPL's installed base of active devices has reached a new record high, with over 1B in global subscribers.
The Services segment continues to report growing revenues - doubled from FY2019 levels, on top of the expanding gross profit margins, naturally triggering bottom-line tailwinds.
With much of AAPL's cash returned to long-term shareholders through raised dividends and upsized share repurchase programs, the stock may continue enjoying bullish support ahead.
As a result, AAPL remains a stock that one may chase at every dip, with another retest of the $160s very likely as the macroeconomic outlook remains uncertain through 2026.
We previously covered Apple ( AAPL ) in February 2024, discussing why it deserved its profitable growth valuations - albeit somewhat pulled forward by the overly optimistic market sentiments, attributed to its increasingly rich operating and Free Cash Flow margins.
However, with the stock already underperforming the SPY and QQQ on a YTD and twelve months basis, worsened by the uncertain market sentiments from the slowdown in iPhone sales, we had rated the stock as a Hold then while highlighting that a moderate pullback to the $165s might be possible....",16
2024-05-06,Apple: Stay Away During This AI Make-Or-Break Moment,"Apple's stock performance has lagged behind other Big Tech companies since the launch of ChatGPT, raising questions about its positioning in the AI revolution.
Apple's growth has been slowing, particularly in iPhone sales, while its services revenue continues to grow.
Apple's financial strength, with a net surplus of funds and a focus on returning value to shareholders, is impressive, but some investors question the company's lack of investment in innovation.
We initiate with a HOLD rating, we also recommend aligning your holdings with the benchmark level.
Introduction
Apple ( AAPL ) finds itself amidst intense debates after over a year and a half of lagging performance compared to both other big tech giants and the broader S&P 500 Index ( SPY ). This prolonged underperformance has led many investors to question AAPL's longstanding position as an untouchable leader in the tech industry. As skepticism mounts, discussions regarding AAPL's future trajectory have intensified, with divergent opinions emerging.
Some investors maintain a strong confidence in AAPL's resilience, citing its formidable market position and robust ecosystem. However, others argue that the company may be vulnerable to disruption from established and emerging competitors. Additionally, there is speculation that AAPL's current weaknesses could create opportunities for new entrants with innovative products to challenge its dominance. ...",16

2024-05-06,Stocks to Sell: 3 Wall Street Darlings About to Become Investor Nightmares,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Recent first-quarter earnings reports have underlined the level of uncertainty surrounding tech stocks at a time when confounding Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) inflation figures have had an adverse impact on Wall Street.
The news of March inflation data being hotter than expected at 3.5% caused widespread concern across U.S. markets. And the prospect of multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts arriving in 2024 are diminishing as a result.
Markets had largely priced in rate cuts arriving as early as March 2024 earlier this year. So, it’s unsurprising that the S&P 500 fell nearly 4% in April off the back of bad news.
Also, this poses fresh challenges for some key members of Wall Street’s Magnificent Seven. These tech stocks have been major beneficiaries of positive market sentiment. Now, as optimism recedes, we’re seeing more frailties emerge. As a result, these three U.S. bets could be moving into sell territory.
Apple (AAPL)

With a market capitalization of over $2.5 trillion, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has long enjoyed an extensive market share. They’ve had higher profit margins due to the company’s commitment to innovation and high-spec technology.
However, storm clouds appear to be circling for the Wall Street giant. In January, the stock was downgraded by Barclays . This was due to weaker performance in China and a lack of iPhone innovation in recent years.
The stock has since declined more than 8% since the beginning of the year. And, the recent news that Q1 sales in China, the world’s biggest market, have fallen 20% as the same period last year, likely raises concern.
In addition, rival smartphone firm Huawei’s profits have recently risen six-fold . It seems the company found a way to eat into Apple’s market share despite Western sanctions.
All of this has left Apple looking for new opportunities to out-innovate rivals. True, the launch of the Vision Pro has opened the company up to a new market. But Apple’s slower adoption of generative artificial intelligence ( AI ) hurt the short-term recovery of the stock.
As a result, AAPL’s mounting challenges could ultimately damage the stock’s status as a Wall Street darling. Thus, the company must find a fresh avenue for tangible innovation.
Tesla (TSLA)
Source: kovop / Shutterstock.com
Another stock that’s struggling for momentum in 2024 is Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ). The company has already endured a downgrade from Phillip Securities in Q2 from neutral to reduce. It suffers a lowly price target of $145 due to slower electric vehicle ( EV ) deliveries and pricing pressures.
Also, TSLA fell over 25% this year, with first-quarter adjusted profit down 48% and revenue declining 9% compared to Q1 of 2023.
With a price war raging among EV manufacturers in China, there’s a danger that Tesla will become collateral damage. Firms are bidding to secure higher sales volumes throughout global markets.
Then, of course, we can’t overlook the tumultuous leadership of Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) Elon Musk. Recently, he fired Tesla’s entire team of 500 employees behind the firm’s supercharger network. However, it’s important to note that Musk’s idiosyncratic approach to managing the company has contributed to its recent struggles as well as its impressive rally toward becoming one of Wall Street’s most valuable stocks.
Additionally, it’s a testament to Musk’s leadership that the stock has recently experienced some growth. That followed a reported deal to roll out Tesla’s self-driving technology in China. It was described as a “watershed moment” by Wedbush analyst Dan Ives .
Thus, Tesla is a largely unpredictable stock at this moment in time, and for risk-averse investors, it is certainly a sell as the company tries to stop its long-term slide.
Meta Platforms (META)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
Unlike the other stocks, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) is enjoying a strong start to 2024, growing more than 40% in the first quarter alone. However, the tech giant may face future problems stemming from its significant bet on the AI boom.
Notably, AI and generative AI in particular have been big business over the past year. Meta Platforms raised its outlook for total expenses for 2024 to $96-$99 billion which represent a major outlay.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been a longtime cheerleader for AI. And while the company has managed to grow alongside the wider generative AI boom, the industry has remained largely speculative. Therefore, Meta’s heavy spending could represent a gamble for the company if other revenue streams decline.
The firm has experienced slower ad sales to Chinese advertisers , which was previously responsible for five percentage points of Meta’s growth in 2023. This points to a possible struggle to sustain momentum should its AI investments fail to pay off in the long-term.

2024-05-06,Baidu Stock Analysis: It's Surprisingly Cheap to Bet on China's ChatGPT,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ) is more than just a search-engine provider. Indeed, with Baidu stock, you’ll get to participate in China’s counterpart to OpenAI’s artificial intelligence chatbot, ChatGPT.
Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) made a brilliant move when it invested in OpenAI’s ChatGPT technology. In 2024, there are other popular generative AI chatbots besides ChatGPT. I encourage you to invest in Baidu.
Baidu Isn’t Just China’s Google
It’s easy to pigeonhole Baidu as the Chinese version of Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google search engine. And I’ll admit, just as Google is Alphabet’s bread and butter, Baidu generates significant revenue from its popular search engine.
Yet, it’s not fair to pigeonhole Baidu in this way. For example, Baidu launched the first 24/7 robo-taxi service in China. Also, Baidu is an important AI-technology develop.
In fact, per The Wall Street Journal , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) “ held preliminary talks with” Baidu about the possibility of using Baidu’s generative-AI technology in Apple’s devices in China.
Furthermore, Baidu recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Nissan Motor (OTCMKTS: NSANY ) to conduct research on AI and “smart cars.” Not only that, but the agreement calls for Nissan to “equip its Chinese cars with Baidu’s AI products,” Reuters reported.
Baidu’s AI Chatbot Achieves a Milestone
Clearly, Baidu is making its presence known as an AI-tech contender. Investors should keep an eye out for more partnerships, as the Baidu-Nissan MOU might only be the start of an ongoing trend.
Additionally, Baidu is quickly staking its claim as a gen-AI juggernaut in the company’s home country. U.S.-based stock traders might not be aware of this, but Baidu’s ERNIE Bot gen-AI chatbot is gaining serious traction in China.
Recently, Baidu achieves a major milestone when its ERNIE Bot “amassed 200 million users .” That’s what I would call ultra-rapid growth, as ERNIE Bot debuted on March 16, 2023.
This is a perfect example of why U.S. investors should broaden their horizons. ERNIE Bot has a huge presence in China, just like ChatGPT does in America.
Thus, investigating investment opportunities abroad can alert you to new and interesting stock ideas.
Baidu Stock: Grab This While It’s Still Cheap
Are you seeking prime gen-AI exposure in your portfolio, but at a great price? Look no further.
Baidu’s GAAP trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is 12.94x , versus the sector median P/E ratio of 18.98x. Hence, there’s a terrific bargain that’s ripe for the picking.
It’s a shame that some American investors won’t take advantage of this. Maybe they’ve unfairly pigeonholed Baidu or they’re just not aware of the company.
So, feel free to grab some Baidu stock shares while they’re still cheap, as they’ll probably be much more expensive in a year or two.

Does the company’s buyback announcement portend a lack of reinvestment opportunities for the core business? Probably not.
However, Apple's AI announcement this coming week has to get the attention of the Street.
Will AI's capex surge reduce technology stock valuations? The mega cap 7 or mega cap 10 stocks could trade listlessly for a few quarters as the true ""capex"" is worked out.
Capex: FASB - the Financial Accounting Standards Board - defines “capex” as “the investment required to sustain the economics of a business”. Capex is not an expense, i.e., a deduction from revenue, but rather is a “capitalized” item that shows up on the statement of cash flow in the “investing” section, and before the 1980s services economy exploded, was traditionally “payments for property, plant and equipment” that weren’t expensed, but capitalized, and then depreciated over the useful life of an asset.

2024-05-06,Where Will Apple Stock Be in 1 Year?,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) posted its latest earnings report on May 2. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on March 31), the tech giant's revenue fell 4% year over year to $90.8 billion but exceeded analysts' estimates by $190 million. Net income dipped 2% to $23.6 billion, but the company's $43.3 billion in buybacks boosted its diluted EPS by a penny to $1.53 and cleared the consensus forecast by $0.03.
Apple's growth rates were anemic, but it boosted its quarterly dividend by 4% to $0.25 a share, which translates to a forward yield of 0.5%; and authorized a new $110 billion buyback plan, which is equivalent to 4% of its market cap.

2024-05-06,Time to Sell These 3 Under-Performing Stocks Based on Their Bad Decisions,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Sometimes great companies fail to respond effectively to huge, new threats because they’re stuck in a rut and become stocks to sell. The classic example of this phenomenon is Blockbuster’s failure to acquire Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) when it had a golden opportunity to easily do so. For the readers who are too young to remember Blockbuster and haven’t heard about it, the company relied on renting DVDs through brick-and-mortar stores. In 2000, money-losing Netflix was renting DVDs through the mail and, I believe, had the vision of one day streaming movies. In that year, Netflix offered to sell itself to Blockbuster for just $50 million, and Blockbuster refused the offer.
Obviously, Blockbuster’s decision to simply stay the course in the face of huge technological changes proved to be disastrous. The chain subsequently declared bankruptcy and ceased to exist. Here are three contemporary firms that, like Blockbuster, are failing to react effectively to gigantic, looming problems. As a result, I view these names as stocks to sell.
Starbucks (SBUX)
Source: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com
Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) is facing huge competition in China and the U.S. from coffee brands Luckin Coffee (OTCMKTS: LKNCY ) and Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS ). I believe that the key factor behind Starbucks’ recently reported disastrous fiscal second-quarter results was the tough competition from these two rapidly growing firms.
In my opinion, Starbucks made a crucial error by failing to acquire Luckin and/or Dutch Bros when they were trading at much lower levels. If Starbucks had offered to buy them in 2022, for example, the coffee giant could have obtained them for a relatively small sum.
As long as Dutch Bros and Luckin continue to expand and gain market share, I believe that Starbucks will be, at best, “dead money” going forward. Consequently, it’s definitely among stocks to sell.
Walt Disney (DIS)
Source: chrisdorney / Shutterstock
For many years, I’ve believed that Walt Disney’s (NYSE: DIS ) two largest businesses, cable TV channels and movies, were going to shrink dramatically. And, so far, my thesis has certainly proven to be accurate. Cord cutting is continuously reducing cable subscriber totals and Americans are visiting movie theaters much less than they once did. There is also significant competition in the streaming sector. As a result, I thought that Disney’s streaming services would not be a good way to compensate for the declining profits of its cable channel and movie businesses. The latter theory has also proved to be on target, as the conglomerate’s streaming channels still aren’t profitable.
Disney’s decision to put so many of its eggs in the streaming basket was certainly erroneous, as was its decision to spend a huge $71.3 billion on buying 21st Century Fox. By that year, Disney should have seen that its movie and cable assets were headed for big problems.
Instead, Disney should have doubled down on its highly successful parks business by building and/or acquiring parks in additional countries. Buying an online sports betting company company and trying to promote it through ESPN also would have made sense.
The conglomerate very belatedly took a tentative step in that direction by launching a sports-betting partnership with Penn Entertainment (NASDAQ: PENN ) last year. But Disney is not going to directly obtain revenue from the deal. Moreover, the companies’ venture, called, ESPN Bet has a huge disadvantage because it was launched so many years after other companies in the space had already acquired a high number of customers.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com
Last quarter, Apple’s top line dropped a dismal 4.3% versus the same period a year earlier to $90.75 billion. Even more importantly, last quarter was the fifth out of the last six quarters that the storied company’s revenue has fallen. Moreover, the sales generated by the tech giant’s flagship products tumbled a huge 10.5% YOY last quarter.
The firm is supposed to enhance the iPhone with AI capabilities later this year. But, given the company’s inability under CEO Tim Cook to introduce truly needle-moving product initiatives, I don’t expect the changes to boost the iPhone’s sales significantly, let alone meaningfully increase the company’s overall top line.
Apple could have and should have acquired Roku (NASDDAQ: ROKU ). If the tech giant had advertised Apple TV on the platform, its streaming initiative would have become a big success. And it would have been able to tout its many other products on Roku, which could have significantly lifted sales of these other offerings.

2024-05-06,Even Worse than Gamestop? 3 Meme Stocks That Are Screaming Sells,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
You’ll get no argument from me that GameStop (NYSE: GME ) is one of the best meme stocks to sell. However, the video game retailer has been around a long time, suggesting it’s not the worst of the meme stocks to sell.
So who is?
QuiverQuant.com provides data on the top meme stocks in U.S. stock exchanges. One of its data points is the WallStreetBets score , based on the number of times a company is mentioned on the subreddit over the past week.
GameStop has a 95 rating out of 100, which is quite high. Eight others have scores higher than 95. Those would be good candidates for meme stocks to sell.
There are other stocks with lower scores that I would sell in a heartbeat, such as AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC ), which clocks in at 94. I won’t select it because I’m tired of getting emails from AMC bulls complaining about my lack of objectivity. Crap is crap.
Anyway, this list of top meme stocks includes some names worth owning. I’ll save these for another time.
ImmunityBio (IBRX)
Source: everything possible / Shutterstock.com
ImmunityBio (NASDAQ: IBRX ) has a WallStreetBets score of 97, which means it gets a lot of chatter. Many investors may not be familiar with it, but it has a $6.1 billion market capitalization.
“ImmunityBio is a vertically integrated biotechnology company developing next-generation therapies and vaccines that bolster the natural immune system to defeat cancers and infectious diseases,” states the company’s investor relations site,” the company’s investor relations site states .
Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong founded ImmunityBio in 2014 . He is the Executive Chairman and owns nearly 83% of the company through various affiliated businesses. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, he’s worth $12.6 billion , up $2.1 billion in 2024.
If he’s as good at running a biotech firm as a newspaper — he bought the Los Angeles Times in 2018 for $500 million — you don’t want anything to do with ImmunityBio.
One benefit of owning the largest paper on the West Coast is that it gets to announce ImmunityBio news. On April 22, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved Antika, the company’s treatment for bladder cancer. As a result, Antika’s shares are up 70% over the past month.
While good news, it will have to sell a lot of Antika to eliminate the nearly $3 billion accumulated deficit on its balance sheet.
MicroStrategy (MSTR)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR ) has a WallStreetBets score of 96.
There was a time when I thought Chairman and co-founder Michael Saylor’s strategy of buying Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) for his data analytics software business’s balance sheet wasn’t a terrible idea.
When Saylor started buying BTC in August 2020, the Federal Reserve’s Federal Funds Effective Rate, or FRED, was 0.10% . Today, it’s 5.33%. With cash balances delivering negligible income, it couldn’t hurt to put excess cash into an appreciating asset. Bitcoin at the time was $11,670 . Today, it’s over $58,000.
The company reported its Q1 2024 results on April 29. They missed on both the top and bottom lines. Its shares fell nearly 10% on the news.
In February, I argued that MicroStrategy wasn’t a good data analytics stock because Bitcoin obscured its operating business, which isn’t a high-growth enterprise. Its software-related revenue fell 5.5% in the first quarter to $115.2 million.
The problem is that it went from an operating loss of $20.3 million in Q1 2023 to a $203.7 million loss in the latest quarter. This was because of Bitcoin losses in the three months ended March 31, 2024.
Unlike Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B ), which provides investors with a lower-risk way of owning Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), MicroStrategy does not do the same for Bitcoin.
If you want to own the cryptocurrency, buy it directly or purchase one of the many Bitcoin trusts.
Rumble (RUM)
Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com
Rumble (NASDAQ: RMBL ) has a WallStreetBets score of 63, well below GameStop’s 95 score. I picked Rumble because it’s another example of misguided loyalty to all things Donald Trump.
The good news if you bought RUM stock at the beginning of the year is that you’re up more than 55% year-to-date. The bad news is this is about as good as it will get. The stock got as high as $18.52 in February 2022. It remains well down from its 2022 highs despite this year’s gains.
The gains in 2024 are two-fold: First, the same people gobbling up Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ: DJT ) stock also buy Rumble because of its video partnership with Truth Social, TMTG’s social media platform. Secondly, it signed a partnership with Barstool Sports that puts all of Barstool Sports’ content on the Rumble platform.
“I’m excited about Rumble’s commitment to sports and broadening audiences,” said Dave Portnoy, Founder of Barstool Sports. “With the power of Barstool Sports, we are going to help Rumble be the top player in the video, cloud, and livestreaming space.”
It all sounds terrific. Unfortunately, it doesn’t pay the bills.
In 2023, Rumble generated $81 million , which is a heck of a lot more than Trump Media, but it was flat quarter to quarter while losing nearly $136 million in the past year, or $1.68 per dollar of sales, up from 91 cents per dollar of sales in 2022.

2024-05-05,Learn How to Profit From Elon Musk's $18 Billion AI Project,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Editor’s Note: This article was previously published under the title, “How to Profit From Elon Musk’s $18 Billion AI Project” but has been updated to include the most recent information.
The global AI Race has begun, and it’s off to a red-hot start. Companies like Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ) and Apple ( AAPL ) – among countless others – are all pouring billions of dollars into this groundbreaking tech.
Why? Because they know that the winner of the AI Race will inevitably become the world’s most powerful company.
But funnily enough, the ultimate winner may not be any of those Big Tech companies.
Rather, it may be a company that you’ve likely never heard of before…
I’m talking about xAI, Elon Musk’s newest AI startup.
A New AI Frontrunner?
About a year ago, Elon Musk set out to create his own AI startup, xAI. He felt that his competitors were all missing the ultimate goal of creating powerful and fair AI. Now, just over a year later, that startup is working to raise $3 billion at an $18 billion valuation.
That is huge growth for a company in just under a year.
But xAI’s growth story could just be getting started.
After all, Apple didn’t become Apple because of the iPhone. It became Apple because of Steve Jobs.
Microsoft didn’t become Microsoft because of Windows. It became Microsoft because of Bill Gates.
World-changing people create world-changing businesses.
So… if you want to invest in world-changing businesses… start by investing in world-changing people.
We certainly believe that Elon Musk is a world-changer.
He co-founded PayPal ( PYPL ), the world’s largest digital payment platform, now worth more than $70 billion…
And SpaceX , the world’s largest private space rocket firm, now worth $180 billion.
He pioneered the world’s largest automaker in Tesla ( TSLA ), which is now worth more than all of the next 10 biggest automakers combined…
And he’s also the man behind Neuralink , The Boring Company , and X .
Musk has influenced how we pay for things, what cars we drive, how we communicate online, how we see space…
I’d venture to say that he is one of the most influential business figures of the past 20 years.
A great example of world-changing.
The Final Word
And now this world-changing person has turned his focus to a new business venture at the heart of possibly the most transformative technology the world has ever seen: AI.
Would you bet against him here?
I don’t think I would.
xAI has already launched an impressive AI chatbot named Grok, which many experts claim stacks up pound-for-pound against ChatGPT. And as we mentioned above, the firm is already in talks to raise $3 billion at an $18 billion valuation.
This latest startup is moving fast. With impressive progress. And the journey is likely just getting started.
Because xAI could be Musk’s biggest venture yet.
And right now, you have an opportunity to invest in it.
Now, not directly, of course – xAI is barely a year old. It is still a private startup.
But we have found a potentially huge “backdoor” investment opportunity into xAI. It’s a stock that you’ve likely have never heard of before, but we think it could be xAI’s leading tech component supplier.
If xAI becomes a champion of the multi-trillion-dollar AI race, then this stock could absolutely soar.
Get all the details about this little-known supplier.

2024-05-06,Apple: Those Who Harp On iPhone Sales Miss The Point,"Those who focus on decelerating iPhone sales have missed the point indeed, since the smart devices are a means to an end - attracting users to its highly sticky ecosystem.
AAPL's installed base of active devices has reached a new record high, with over 1B in global subscribers.
The Services segment continues to report growing revenues - doubled from FY2019 levels, on top of the expanding gross profit margins, naturally triggering bottom-line tailwinds.
With much of AAPL's cash returned to long-term shareholders through raised dividends and upsized share repurchase programs, the stock may continue enjoying bullish support ahead.
As a result, AAPL remains a stock that one may chase at every dip, with another retest of the $160s very likely as the macroeconomic outlook remains uncertain through 2026.
We previously covered Apple ( AAPL ) in February 2024, discussing why it deserved its profitable growth valuations - albeit somewhat pulled forward by the overly optimistic market sentiments, attributed to its increasingly rich operating and Free Cash Flow margins.
However, with the stock already underperforming the SPY and QQQ on a YTD and twelve months basis, worsened by the uncertain market sentiments from the slowdown in iPhone sales, we had rated the stock as a Hold then while highlighting that a moderate pullback to the $165s might be possible....",17

Apple's financial strength, with a net surplus of funds and a focus on returning value to shareholders, is impressive, but some investors question the company's lack of investment in innovation.
We initiate with a HOLD rating, we also recommend aligning your holdings with the benchmark level.
Introduction
Apple ( AAPL ) finds itself amidst intense debates after over a year and a half of lagging performance compared to both other big tech giants and the broader S&P 500 Index ( SPY ). This prolonged underperformance has led many investors to question AAPL's longstanding position as an untouchable leader in the tech industry. As skepticism mounts, discussions regarding AAPL's future trajectory have intensified, with divergent opinions emerging.
Some investors maintain a strong confidence in AAPL's resilience, citing its formidable market position and robust ecosystem. However, others argue that the company may be vulnerable to disruption from established and emerging competitors. Additionally, there is speculation that AAPL's current weaknesses could create opportunities for new entrants with innovative products to challenge its dominance. ...",17

2024-05-06,Stocks to Sell: 3 Wall Street Darlings About to Become Investor Nightmares,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Recent first-quarter earnings reports have underlined the level of uncertainty surrounding tech stocks at a time when confounding Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) inflation figures have had an adverse impact on Wall Street.
The news of March inflation data being hotter than expected at 3.5% caused widespread concern across U.S. markets. And the prospect of multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts arriving in 2024 are diminishing as a result.
Markets had largely priced in rate cuts arriving as early as March 2024 earlier this year. So, it’s unsurprising that the S&P 500 fell nearly 4% in April off the back of bad news.
Also, this poses fresh challenges for some key members of Wall Street’s Magnificent Seven. These tech stocks have been major beneficiaries of positive market sentiment. Now, as optimism recedes, we’re seeing more frailties emerge. As a result, these three U.S. bets could be moving into sell territory.
Apple (AAPL)

With a market capitalization of over $2.5 trillion, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has long enjoyed an extensive market share. They’ve had higher profit margins due to the company’s commitment to innovation and high-spec technology.
However, storm clouds appear to be circling for the Wall Street giant. In January, the stock was downgraded by Barclays . This was due to weaker performance in China and a lack of iPhone innovation in recent years.
The stock has since declined more than 8% since the beginning of the year. And, the recent news that Q1 sales in China, the world’s biggest market, have fallen 20% as the same period last year, likely raises concern.
In addition, rival smartphone firm Huawei’s profits have recently risen six-fold . It seems the company found a way to eat into Apple’s market share despite Western sanctions.
All of this has left Apple looking for new opportunities to out-innovate rivals. True, the launch of the Vision Pro has opened the company up to a new market. But Apple’s slower adoption of generative artificial intelligence ( AI ) hurt the short-term recovery of the stock.
As a result, AAPL’s mounting challenges could ultimately damage the stock’s status as a Wall Street darling. Thus, the company must find a fresh avenue for tangible innovation.
Tesla (TSLA)
Source: kovop / Shutterstock.com
Another stock that’s struggling for momentum in 2024 is Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ). The company has already endured a downgrade from Phillip Securities in Q2 from neutral to reduce. It suffers a lowly price target of $145 due to slower electric vehicle ( EV ) deliveries and pricing pressures.
Also, TSLA fell over 25% this year, with first-quarter adjusted profit down 48% and revenue declining 9% compared to Q1 of 2023.
With a price war raging among EV manufacturers in China, there’s a danger that Tesla will become collateral damage. Firms are bidding to secure higher sales volumes throughout global markets.
Then, of course, we can’t overlook the tumultuous leadership of Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) Elon Musk. Recently, he fired Tesla’s entire team of 500 employees behind the firm’s supercharger network. However, it’s important to note that Musk’s idiosyncratic approach to managing the company has contributed to its recent struggles as well as its impressive rally toward becoming one of Wall Street’s most valuable stocks.
Additionally, it’s a testament to Musk’s leadership that the stock has recently experienced some growth. That followed a reported deal to roll out Tesla’s self-driving technology in China. It was described as a “watershed moment” by Wedbush analyst Dan Ives .
Thus, Tesla is a largely unpredictable stock at this moment in time, and for risk-averse investors, it is certainly a sell as the company tries to stop its long-term slide.
Meta Platforms (META)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
Unlike the other stocks, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) is enjoying a strong start to 2024, growing more than 40% in the first quarter alone. However, the tech giant may face future problems stemming from its significant bet on the AI boom.
Notably, AI and generative AI in particular have been big business over the past year. Meta Platforms raised its outlook for total expenses for 2024 to $96-$99 billion which represent a major outlay.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been a longtime cheerleader for AI. And while the company has managed to grow alongside the wider generative AI boom, the industry has remained largely speculative. Therefore, Meta’s heavy spending could represent a gamble for the company if other revenue streams decline.
The firm has experienced slower ad sales to Chinese advertisers , which was previously responsible for five percentage points of Meta’s growth in 2023. This points to a possible struggle to sustain momentum should its AI investments fail to pay off in the long-term.

2024-05-06,Baidu Stock Analysis: It's Surprisingly Cheap to Bet on China's ChatGPT,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ) is more than just a search-engine provider. Indeed, with Baidu stock, you’ll get to participate in China’s counterpart to OpenAI’s artificial intelligence chatbot, ChatGPT.
Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) made a brilliant move when it invested in OpenAI’s ChatGPT technology. In 2024, there are other popular generative AI chatbots besides ChatGPT. I encourage you to invest in Baidu.
Baidu Isn’t Just China’s Google
It’s easy to pigeonhole Baidu as the Chinese version of Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google search engine. And I’ll admit, just as Google is Alphabet’s bread and butter, Baidu generates significant revenue from its popular search engine.
Yet, it’s not fair to pigeonhole Baidu in this way. For example, Baidu launched the first 24/7 robo-taxi service in China. Also, Baidu is an important AI-technology develop.
In fact, per The Wall Street Journal , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) “ held preliminary talks with” Baidu about the possibility of using Baidu’s generative-AI technology in Apple’s devices in China.
Furthermore, Baidu recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Nissan Motor (OTCMKTS: NSANY ) to conduct research on AI and “smart cars.” Not only that, but the agreement calls for Nissan to “equip its Chinese cars with Baidu’s AI products,” Reuters reported.
Baidu’s AI Chatbot Achieves a Milestone
Clearly, Baidu is making its presence known as an AI-tech contender. Investors should keep an eye out for more partnerships, as the Baidu-Nissan MOU might only be the start of an ongoing trend.
Additionally, Baidu is quickly staking its claim as a gen-AI juggernaut in the company’s home country. U.S.-based stock traders might not be aware of this, but Baidu’s ERNIE Bot gen-AI chatbot is gaining serious traction in China.
Recently, Baidu achieves a major milestone when its ERNIE Bot “amassed 200 million users .” That’s what I would call ultra-rapid growth, as ERNIE Bot debuted on March 16, 2023.
This is a perfect example of why U.S. investors should broaden their horizons. ERNIE Bot has a huge presence in China, just like ChatGPT does in America.
Thus, investigating investment opportunities abroad can alert you to new and interesting stock ideas.
Baidu Stock: Grab This While It’s Still Cheap
Are you seeking prime gen-AI exposure in your portfolio, but at a great price? Look no further.
Baidu’s GAAP trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is 12.94x , versus the sector median P/E ratio of 18.98x. Hence, there’s a terrific bargain that’s ripe for the picking.
It’s a shame that some American investors won’t take advantage of this. Maybe they’ve unfairly pigeonholed Baidu or they’re just not aware of the company.
So, feel free to grab some Baidu stock shares while they’re still cheap, as they’ll probably be much more expensive in a year or two.

Does the company’s buyback announcement portend a lack of reinvestment opportunities for the core business? Probably not.
However, Apple's AI announcement this coming week has to get the attention of the Street.
Will AI's capex surge reduce technology stock valuations? The mega cap 7 or mega cap 10 stocks could trade listlessly for a few quarters as the true ""capex"" is worked out.
Capex: FASB - the Financial Accounting Standards Board - defines “capex” as “the investment required to sustain the economics of a business”. Capex is not an expense, i.e., a deduction from revenue, but rather is a “capitalized” item that shows up on the statement of cash flow in the “investing” section, and before the 1980s services economy exploded, was traditionally “payments for property, plant and equipment” that weren’t expensed, but capitalized, and then depreciated over the useful life of an asset.

2024-05-06,Where Will Apple Stock Be in 1 Year?,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) posted its latest earnings report on May 2.

2024-05-06,Time to Sell These 3 Under-Performing Stocks Based on Their Bad Decisions,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Sometimes great companies fail to respond effectively to huge, new threats because they’re stuck in a rut and become stocks to sell. The classic example of this phenomenon is Blockbuster’s failure to acquire Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) when it had a golden opportunity to easily do so. For the readers who are too young to remember Blockbuster and haven’t heard about it, the company relied on renting DVDs through brick-and-mortar stores. In 2000, money-losing Netflix was renting DVDs through the mail and, I believe, had the vision of one day streaming movies. In that year, Netflix offered to sell itself to Blockbuster for just $50 million, and Blockbuster refused the offer.
Obviously, Blockbuster’s decision to simply stay the course in the face of huge technological changes proved to be disastrous. The chain subsequently declared bankruptcy and ceased to exist. Here are three contemporary firms that, like Blockbuster, are failing to react effectively to gigantic, looming problems. As a result, I view these names as stocks to sell.
Starbucks (SBUX)
Source: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com
Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) is facing huge competition in China and the U.S. from coffee brands Luckin Coffee (OTCMKTS: LKNCY ) and Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS ). I believe that the key factor behind Starbucks’ recently reported disastrous fiscal second-quarter results was the tough competition from these two rapidly growing firms.
In my opinion, Starbucks made a crucial error by failing to acquire Luckin and/or Dutch Bros when they were trading at much lower levels. If Starbucks had offered to buy them in 2022, for example, the coffee giant could have obtained them for a relatively small sum.
As long as Dutch Bros and Luckin continue to expand and gain market share, I believe that Starbucks will be, at best, “dead money” going forward. Consequently, it’s definitely among stocks to sell.
Walt Disney (DIS)
Source: chrisdorney / Shutterstock
For many years, I’ve believed that Walt Disney’s (NYSE: DIS ) two largest businesses, cable TV channels and movies, were going to shrink dramatically. And, so far, my thesis has certainly proven to be accurate. Cord cutting is continuously reducing cable subscriber totals and Americans are visiting movie theaters much less than they once did. There is also significant competition in the streaming sector. As a result, I thought that Disney’s streaming services would not be a good way to compensate for the declining profits of its cable channel and movie businesses. The latter theory has also proved to be on target, as the conglomerate’s streaming channels still aren’t profitable.
Disney’s decision to put so many of its eggs in the streaming basket was certainly erroneous, as was its decision to spend a huge $71.3 billion on buying 21st Century Fox. By that year, Disney should have seen that its movie and cable assets were headed for big problems.
Instead, Disney should have doubled down on its highly successful parks business by building and/or acquiring parks in additional countries. Buying an online sports betting company company and trying to promote it through ESPN also would have made sense.
The conglomerate very belatedly took a tentative step in that direction by launching a sports-betting partnership with Penn Entertainment (NASDAQ: PENN ) last year. But Disney is not going to directly obtain revenue from the deal. Moreover, the companies’ venture, called, ESPN Bet has a huge disadvantage because it was launched so many years after other companies in the space had already acquired a high number of customers.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com
Last quarter, Apple’s top line dropped a dismal 4.3% versus the same period a year earlier to $90.75 billion. Even more importantly, last quarter was the fifth out of the last six quarters that the storied company’s revenue has fallen. Moreover, the sales generated by the tech giant’s flagship products tumbled a huge 10.5% YOY last quarter.
The firm is supposed to enhance the iPhone with AI capabilities later this year. But, given the company’s inability under CEO Tim Cook to introduce truly needle-moving product initiatives, I don’t expect the changes to boost the iPhone’s sales significantly, let alone meaningfully increase the company’s overall top line.
Apple could have and should have acquired Roku (NASDDAQ: ROKU ). If the tech giant had advertised Apple TV on the platform, its streaming initiative would have become a big success. And it would have been able to tout its many other products on Roku, which could have significantly lifted sales of these other offerings.

2024-05-06,Even Worse than Gamestop? 3 Meme Stocks That Are Screaming Sells,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
You’ll get no argument from me that GameStop (NYSE: GME ) is one of the best meme stocks to sell. However, the video game retailer has been around a long time, suggesting it’s not the worst of the meme stocks to sell.
So who is?
QuiverQuant.com provides data on the top meme stocks in U.S. stock exchanges. One of its data points is the WallStreetBets score , based on the number of times a company is mentioned on the subreddit over the past week.
GameStop has a 95 rating out of 100, which is quite high. Eight others have scores higher than 95. Those would be good candidates for meme stocks to sell.
There are other stocks with lower scores that I would sell in a heartbeat, such as AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC ), which clocks in at 94. I won’t select it because I’m tired of getting emails from AMC bulls complaining about my lack of objectivity. Crap is crap.
Anyway, this list of top meme stocks includes some names worth owning. I’ll save these for another time.
ImmunityBio (IBRX)
Source: everything possible / Shutterstock.com
ImmunityBio (NASDAQ: IBRX ) has a WallStreetBets score of 97, which means it gets a lot of chatter. Many investors may not be familiar with it, but it has a $6.1 billion market capitalization.
“ImmunityBio is a vertically integrated biotechnology company developing next-generation therapies and vaccines that bolster the natural immune system to defeat cancers and infectious diseases,” states the company’s investor relations site,” the company’s investor relations site states .
Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong founded ImmunityBio in 2014 . He is the Executive Chairman and owns nearly 83% of the company through various affiliated businesses. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, he’s worth $12.6 billion , up $2.1 billion in 2024.
If he’s as good at running a biotech firm as a newspaper — he bought the Los Angeles Times in 2018 for $500 million — you don’t want anything to do with ImmunityBio.
One benefit of owning the largest paper on the West Coast is that it gets to announce ImmunityBio news. On April 22, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved Antika, the company’s treatment for bladder cancer. As a result, Antika’s shares are up 70% over the past month.
While good news, it will have to sell a lot of Antika to eliminate the nearly $3 billion accumulated deficit on its balance sheet.
MicroStrategy (MSTR)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR ) has a WallStreetBets score of 96.
There was a time when I thought Chairman and co-founder Michael Saylor’s strategy of buying Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) for his data analytics software business’s balance sheet wasn’t a terrible idea.
When Saylor started buying BTC in August 2020, the Federal Reserve’s Federal Funds Effective Rate, or FRED, was 0.10% . Today, it’s 5.33%. With cash balances delivering negligible income, it couldn’t hurt to put excess cash into an appreciating asset. Bitcoin at the time was $11,670 . Today, it’s over $58,000.
The company reported its Q1 2024 results on April 29. They missed on both the top and bottom lines. Its shares fell nearly 10% on the news.
In February, I argued that MicroStrategy wasn’t a good data analytics stock because Bitcoin obscured its operating business, which isn’t a high-growth enterprise. Its software-related revenue fell 5.5% in the first quarter to $115.2 million.
The problem is that it went from an operating loss of $20.3 million in Q1 2023 to a $203.7 million loss in the latest quarter. This was because of Bitcoin losses in the three months ended March 31, 2024.
Unlike Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B ), which provides investors with a lower-risk way of owning Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), MicroStrategy does not do the same for Bitcoin.
If you want to own the cryptocurrency, buy it directly or purchase one of the many Bitcoin trusts.
Rumble (RUM)
Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com
Rumble (NASDAQ: RMBL ) has a WallStreetBets score of 63, well below GameStop’s 95 score. I picked Rumble because it’s another example of misguided loyalty to all things Donald Trump.
The good news if you bought RUM stock at the beginning of the year is that you’re up more than 55% year-to-date. The bad news is this is about as good as it will get. The stock got as high as $18.52 in February 2022. It remains well down from its 2022 highs despite this year’s gains.
The gains in 2024 are two-fold: First, the same people gobbling up Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ: DJT ) stock also buy Rumble because of its video partnership with Truth Social, TMTG’s social media platform. Secondly, it signed a partnership with Barstool Sports that puts all of Barstool Sports’ content on the Rumble platform.
“I’m excited about Rumble’s commitment to sports and broadening audiences,” said Dave Portnoy, Founder of Barstool Sports. “With the power of Barstool Sports, we are going to help Rumble be the top player in the video, cloud, and livestreaming space.”
It all sounds terrific. Unfortunately, it doesn’t pay the bills.
In 2023, Rumble generated $81 million , which is a heck of a lot more than Trump Media, but it was flat quarter to quarter while losing nearly $136 million in the past year, or $1.68 per dollar of sales, up from 91 cents per dollar of sales in 2022.
Don’t waste your money.

2024-05-05,Learn How to Profit From Elon Musk's $18 Billion AI Project,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Editor’s Note: This article was previously published under the title, “How to Profit From Elon Musk’s $18 Billion AI Project” but has been updated to include the most recent information.
The global AI Race has begun, and it’s off to a red-hot start. Companies like Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ) and Apple ( AAPL ) – among countless others – are all pouring billions of dollars into this groundbreaking tech.
Why? Because they know that the winner of the AI Race will inevitably become the world’s most powerful company.
But funnily enough, the ultimate winner may not be any of those Big Tech companies.
Rather, it may be a company that you’ve likely never heard of before…
I’m talking about xAI, Elon Musk’s newest AI startup.
A New AI Frontrunner?
About a year ago, Elon Musk set out to create his own AI startup, xAI. He felt that his competitors were all missing the ultimate goal of creating powerful and fair AI. Now, just over a year later, that startup is working to raise $3 billion at an $18 billion valuation.
That is huge growth for a company in just under a year.
But xAI’s growth story could just be getting started.
After all, Apple didn’t become Apple because of the iPhone. It became Apple because of Steve Jobs.
Microsoft didn’t become Microsoft because of Windows. It became Microsoft because of Bill Gates.
World-changing people create world-changing businesses.
So… if you want to invest in world-changing businesses… start by investing in world-changing people.
We certainly believe that Elon Musk is a world-changer.
He co-founded PayPal ( PYPL ), the world’s largest digital payment platform, now worth more than $70 billion…
And SpaceX , the world’s largest private space rocket firm, now worth $180 billion.
He pioneered the world’s largest automaker in Tesla ( TSLA ), which is now worth more than all of the next 10 biggest automakers combined…
And he’s also the man behind Neuralink , The Boring Company , and X .
Musk has influenced how we pay for things, what cars we drive, how we communicate online, how we see space…
I’d venture to say that he is one of the most influential business figures of the past 20 years.
A great example of world-changing.
The Final Word
And now this world-changing person has turned his focus to a new business venture at the heart of possibly the most transformative technology the world has ever seen: AI.
Would you bet against him here?
I don’t think I would.
xAI has already launched an impressive AI chatbot named Grok, which many experts claim stacks up pound-for-pound against ChatGPT. And as we mentioned above, the firm is already in talks to raise $3 billion at an $18 billion valuation.
This latest startup is moving fast. With impressive progress. And the journey is likely just getting started.
Because xAI could be Musk’s biggest venture yet.
And right now, you have an opportunity to invest in it.
Now, not directly, of course – xAI is barely a year old. It is still a private startup.
But we have found a potentially huge “backdoor” investment opportunity into xAI. It’s a stock that you’ve likely have never heard of before, but we think it could be xAI’s leading tech component supplier.
If xAI becomes a champion of the multi-trillion-dollar AI race, then this stock could absolutely soar.
Get all the details about this little-known supplier.

2024-05-06,Apple: Those Who Harp On iPhone Sales Miss The Point,"Those who focus on decelerating iPhone sales have missed the point indeed, since the smart devices are a means to an end - attracting users to its highly sticky ecosystem.
AAPL's installed base of active devices has reached a new record high, with over 1B in global subscribers.
The Services segment continues to report growing revenues - doubled from FY2019 levels, on top of the expanding gross profit margins, naturally triggering bottom-line tailwinds.
With much of AAPL's cash returned to long-term shareholders through raised dividends and upsized share repurchase programs, the stock may continue enjoying bullish support ahead.
As a result, AAPL remains a stock that one may chase at every dip, with another retest of the $160s very likely as the macroeconomic outlook remains uncertain through 2026.
We previously covered Apple ( AAPL ) in February 2024, discussing why it deserved its profitable growth valuations - albeit somewhat pulled forward by the overly optimistic market sentiments, attributed to its increasingly rich operating and Free Cash Flow margins.
However, with the stock already underperforming the SPY and QQQ on a YTD and twelve months basis, worsened by the uncertain market sentiments from the slowdown in iPhone sales, we had rated the stock as a Hold then while highlighting that a moderate pullback to the $165s might be possible....",18

Apple's growth has been slowing, particularly in iPhone sales, while its services revenue continues to grow.
Apple's financial strength, with a net surplus of funds and a focus on returning value to shareholders, is impressive, but some investors question the company's lack of investment in innovation.

Introduction
Apple ( AAPL ) finds itself amidst intense debates after over a year and a half of lagging performance compared to both other big tech giants and the broader S&P 500 Index ( SPY ). This prolonged underperformance has led many investors to question AAPL's longstanding position as an untouchable leader in the tech industry. As skepticism mounts, discussions regarding AAPL's future trajectory have intensified, with divergent opinions emerging.
Some investors maintain a strong confidence in AAPL's resilience, citing its formidable market position and robust ecosystem. However, others argue that the company may be vulnerable to disruption from established and emerging competitors. Additionally, there is speculation that AAPL's current weaknesses could create opportunities for new entrants with innovative products to challenge its dominance. ...",18

2024-05-06,Stocks to Sell: 3 Wall Street Darlings About to Become Investor Nightmares,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Recent first-quarter earnings reports have underlined the level of uncertainty surrounding tech stocks at a time when confounding Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) inflation figures have had an adverse impact on Wall Street.
The news of March inflation data being hotter than expected at 3.5% caused widespread concern across U.S. markets. And the prospect of multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts arriving in 2024 are diminishing as a result.
Markets had largely priced in rate cuts arriving as early as March 2024 earlier this year. So, it’s unsurprising that the S&P 500 fell nearly 4% in April off the back of bad news.
Also, this poses fresh challenges for some key members of Wall Street’s Magnificent Seven. These tech stocks have been major beneficiaries of positive market sentiment. Now, as optimism recedes, we’re seeing more frailties emerge. As a result, these three U.S. bets could be moving into sell territory.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Moab Republic / Shutterstock
With a market capitalization of over $2.5 trillion, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has long enjoyed an extensive market share. They’ve had higher profit margins due to the company’s commitment to innovation and high-spec technology.
However, storm clouds appear to be circling for the Wall Street giant. In January, the stock was downgraded by Barclays . This was due to weaker performance in China and a lack of iPhone innovation in recent years.
The stock has since declined more than 8% since the beginning of the year. And, the recent news that Q1 sales in China, the world’s biggest market, have fallen 20% as the same period last year, likely raises concern.
In addition, rival smartphone firm Huawei’s profits have recently risen six-fold . It seems the company found a way to eat into Apple’s market share despite Western sanctions.
All of this has left Apple looking for new opportunities to out-innovate rivals. True, the launch of the Vision Pro has opened the company up to a new market. But Apple’s slower adoption of generative artificial intelligence ( AI ) hurt the short-term recovery of the stock.
As a result, AAPL’s mounting challenges could ultimately damage the stock’s status as a Wall Street darling. Thus, the company must find a fresh avenue for tangible innovation.
Tesla (TSLA)
Source: kovop / Shutterstock.com
Another stock that’s struggling for momentum in 2024 is Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ). The company has already endured a downgrade from Phillip Securities in Q2 from neutral to reduce. It suffers a lowly price target of $145 due to slower electric vehicle ( EV ) deliveries and pricing pressures.
Also, TSLA fell over 25% this year, with first-quarter adjusted profit down 48% and revenue declining 9% compared to Q1 of 2023.
With a price war raging among EV manufacturers in China, there’s a danger that Tesla will become collateral damage. Firms are bidding to secure higher sales volumes throughout global markets.
Then, of course, we can’t overlook the tumultuous leadership of Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) Elon Musk. Recently, he fired Tesla’s entire team of 500 employees behind the firm’s supercharger network. However, it’s important to note that Musk’s idiosyncratic approach to managing the company has contributed to its recent struggles as well as its impressive rally toward becoming one of Wall Street’s most valuable stocks.
Additionally, it’s a testament to Musk’s leadership that the stock has recently experienced some growth. That followed a reported deal to roll out Tesla’s self-driving technology in China. It was described as a “watershed moment” by Wedbush analyst Dan Ives .
Thus, Tesla is a largely unpredictable stock at this moment in time, and for risk-averse investors, it is certainly a sell as the company tries to stop its long-term slide.
Meta Platforms (META)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
Unlike the other stocks, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) is enjoying a strong start to 2024, growing more than 40% in the first quarter alone. However, the tech giant may face future problems stemming from its significant bet on the AI boom.
Notably, AI and generative AI in particular have been big business over the past year. Meta Platforms raised its outlook for total expenses for 2024 to $96-$99 billion which represent a major outlay.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been a longtime cheerleader for AI. And while the company has managed to grow alongside the wider generative AI boom, the industry has remained largely speculative. Therefore, Meta’s heavy spending could represent a gamble for the company if other revenue streams decline.
The firm has experienced slower ad sales to Chinese advertisers , which was previously responsible for five percentage points of Meta’s growth in 2023. This points to a possible struggle to sustain momentum should its AI investments fail to pay off in the long-term.

2024-05-06,Baidu Stock Analysis: It's Surprisingly Cheap to Bet on China's ChatGPT,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ) is more than just a search-engine provider. Indeed, with Baidu stock, you’ll get to participate in China’s counterpart to OpenAI’s artificial intelligence chatbot, ChatGPT.
Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) made a brilliant move when it invested in OpenAI’s ChatGPT technology. In 2024, there are other popular generative AI chatbots besides ChatGPT. I encourage you to invest in Baidu.
Baidu Isn’t Just China’s Google
It’s easy to pigeonhole Baidu as the Chinese version of Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google search engine. And I’ll admit, just as Google is Alphabet’s bread and butter, Baidu generates significant revenue from its popular search engine.
Yet, it’s not fair to pigeonhole Baidu in this way. For example, Baidu launched the first 24/7 robo-taxi service in China. Also, Baidu is an important AI-technology develop.
In fact, per The Wall Street Journal , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) “ held preliminary talks with” Baidu about the possibility of using Baidu’s generative-AI technology in Apple’s devices in China.
Furthermore, Baidu recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Nissan Motor (OTCMKTS: NSANY ) to conduct research on AI and “smart cars.” Not only that, but the agreement calls for Nissan to “equip its Chinese cars with Baidu’s AI products,” Reuters reported.
Baidu’s AI Chatbot Achieves a Milestone
Clearly, Baidu is making its presence known as an AI-tech contender. Investors should keep an eye out for more partnerships, as the Baidu-Nissan MOU might only be the start of an ongoing trend.
Additionally, Baidu is quickly staking its claim as a gen-AI juggernaut in the company’s home country. U.S.-based stock traders might not be aware of this, but Baidu’s ERNIE Bot gen-AI chatbot is gaining serious traction in China.
Recently, Baidu achieves a major milestone when its ERNIE Bot “amassed 200 million users .” That’s what I would call ultra-rapid growth, as ERNIE Bot debuted on March 16, 2023.
This is a perfect example of why U.S. investors should broaden their horizons. ERNIE Bot has a huge presence in China, just like ChatGPT does in America.

Are you seeking prime gen-AI exposure in your portfolio, but at a great price? Look no further.
Baidu’s GAAP trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is 12.94x , versus the sector median P/E ratio of 18.98x. Hence, there’s a terrific bargain that’s ripe for the picking.
It’s a shame that some American investors won’t take advantage of this. Maybe they’ve unfairly pigeonholed Baidu or they’re just not aware of the company.
So, feel free to grab some Baidu stock shares while they’re still cheap, as they’ll probably be much more expensive in a year or two.

2024-05-06,"Will AI's Capex Strain Lower Tech Stock Valuations, And Apple's Buyback Might Be Misunderstood","Apple announced on May 2nd that their plan was to buy back an additional $110 billion in common stock over time. Does the company’s buyback announcement portend a lack of reinvestment opportunities for the core business? Probably not.
However, Apple's AI announcement this coming week has to get the attention of the Street.
Will AI's capex surge reduce technology stock valuations? The mega cap 7 or mega cap 10 stocks could trade listlessly for a few quarters as the true ""capex"" is worked out.
Capex: FASB - the Financial Accounting Standards Board - defines “capex” as “the investment required to sustain the economics of a business”. Capex is not an expense, i.e., a deduction from revenue, but rather is a “capitalized” item that shows up on the statement of cash flow in the “investing” section, and before the 1980s services economy exploded, was traditionally “payments for property, plant and equipment” that weren’t expensed, but capitalized, and then depreciated over the useful life of an asset.

2024-05-06,Where Will Apple Stock Be in 1 Year?,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) posted its latest earnings report on May 2. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on March 31), the tech giant's revenue fell 4% year over year to $90.8 billion but exceeded analysts' estimates by $190 million. Net income dipped 2% to $23.6 billion, but the company's $43.3 billion in buybacks boosted its diluted EPS by a penny to $1.53 and cleared the consensus forecast by $0.03.
Apple's growth rates were anemic, but it boosted its quarterly dividend by 4% to $0.25 a share, which translates to a forward yield of 0.5%; and authorized a new $110 billion buyback plan, which is equivalent to 4% of its market cap.

2024-05-06,Time to Sell These 3 Under-Performing Stocks Based on Their Bad Decisions,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Sometimes great companies fail to respond effectively to huge, new threats because they’re stuck in a rut and become stocks to sell. The classic example of this phenomenon is Blockbuster’s failure to acquire Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) when it had a golden opportunity to easily do so. For the readers who are too young to remember Blockbuster and haven’t heard about it, the company relied on renting DVDs through brick-and-mortar stores. In 2000, money-losing Netflix was renting DVDs through the mail and, I believe, had the vision of one day streaming movies. In that year, Netflix offered to sell itself to Blockbuster for just $50 million, and Blockbuster refused the offer.
Obviously, Blockbuster’s decision to simply stay the course in the face of huge technological changes proved to be disastrous. The chain subsequently declared bankruptcy and ceased to exist. Here are three contemporary firms that, like Blockbuster, are failing to react effectively to gigantic, looming problems. As a result, I view these names as stocks to sell.
Starbucks (SBUX)
Source: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com
Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) is facing huge competition in China and the U.S. from coffee brands Luckin Coffee (OTCMKTS: LKNCY ) and Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS ). I believe that the key factor behind Starbucks’ recently reported disastrous fiscal second-quarter results was the tough competition from these two rapidly growing firms.
In my opinion, Starbucks made a crucial error by failing to acquire Luckin and/or Dutch Bros when they were trading at much lower levels. If Starbucks had offered to buy them in 2022, for example, the coffee giant could have obtained them for a relatively small sum.
As long as Dutch Bros and Luckin continue to expand and gain market share, I believe that Starbucks will be, at best, “dead money” going forward. Consequently, it’s definitely among stocks to sell.
Walt Disney (DIS)
Source: chrisdorney / Shutterstock
For many years, I’ve believed that Walt Disney’s (NYSE: DIS ) two largest businesses, cable TV channels and movies, were going to shrink dramatically. And, so far, my thesis has certainly proven to be accurate. Cord cutting is continuously reducing cable subscriber totals and Americans are visiting movie theaters much less than they once did. There is also significant competition in the streaming sector. As a result, I thought that Disney’s streaming services would not be a good way to compensate for the declining profits of its cable channel and movie businesses. The latter theory has also proved to be on target, as the conglomerate’s streaming channels still aren’t profitable.
Disney’s decision to put so many of its eggs in the streaming basket was certainly erroneous, as was its decision to spend a huge $71.3 billion on buying 21st Century Fox. By that year, Disney should have seen that its movie and cable assets were headed for big problems.
Instead, Disney should have doubled down on its highly successful parks business by building and/or acquiring parks in additional countries. Buying an online sports betting company company and trying to promote it through ESPN also would have made sense.
The conglomerate very belatedly took a tentative step in that direction by launching a sports-betting partnership with Penn Entertainment (NASDAQ: PENN ) last year. But Disney is not going to directly obtain revenue from the deal. Moreover, the companies’ venture, called, ESPN Bet has a huge disadvantage because it was launched so many years after other companies in the space had already acquired a high number of customers.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com
Last quarter, Apple’s top line dropped a dismal 4.3% versus the same period a year earlier to $90.75 billion. Even more importantly, last quarter was the fifth out of the last six quarters that the storied company’s revenue has fallen. Moreover, the sales generated by the tech giant’s flagship products tumbled a huge 10.5% YOY last quarter.
The firm is supposed to enhance the iPhone with AI capabilities later this year. But, given the company’s inability under CEO Tim Cook to introduce truly needle-moving product initiatives, I don’t expect the changes to boost the iPhone’s sales significantly, let alone meaningfully increase the company’s overall top line.
Apple could have and should have acquired Roku (NASDDAQ: ROKU ). If the tech giant had advertised Apple TV on the platform, its streaming initiative would have become a big success. And it would have been able to tout its many other products on Roku, which could have significantly lifted sales of these other offerings.

2024-05-06,Even Worse than Gamestop? 3 Meme Stocks That Are Screaming Sells,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
You’ll get no argument from me that GameStop (NYSE: GME ) is one of the best meme stocks to sell. However, the video game retailer has been around a long time, suggesting it’s not the worst of the meme stocks to sell.
So who is?
QuiverQuant.com provides data on the top meme stocks in U.S. stock exchanges. One of its data points is the WallStreetBets score , based on the number of times a company is mentioned on the subreddit over the past week.
GameStop has a 95 rating out of 100, which is quite high. Eight others have scores higher than 95. Those would be good candidates for meme stocks to sell.
There are other stocks with lower scores that I would sell in a heartbeat, such as AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC ), which clocks in at 94. I won’t select it because I’m tired of getting emails from AMC bulls complaining about my lack of objectivity. Crap is crap.
Anyway, this list of top meme stocks includes some names worth owning. I’ll save these for another time.
ImmunityBio (IBRX)
Source: everything possible / Shutterstock.com
ImmunityBio (NASDAQ: IBRX ) has a WallStreetBets score of 97, which means it gets a lot of chatter. Many investors may not be familiar with it, but it has a $6.1 billion market capitalization.
“ImmunityBio is a vertically integrated biotechnology company developing next-generation therapies and vaccines that bolster the natural immune system to defeat cancers and infectious diseases,” states the company’s investor relations site,” the company’s investor relations site states .
Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong founded ImmunityBio in 2014 . He is the Executive Chairman and owns nearly 83% of the company through various affiliated businesses. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, he’s worth $12.6 billion , up $2.1 billion in 2024.
If he’s as good at running a biotech firm as a newspaper — he bought the Los Angeles Times in 2018 for $500 million — you don’t want anything to do with ImmunityBio.
One benefit of owning the largest paper on the West Coast is that it gets to announce ImmunityBio news. On April 22, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved Antika, the company’s treatment for bladder cancer. As a result, Antika’s shares are up 70% over the past month.
While good news, it will have to sell a lot of Antika to eliminate the nearly $3 billion accumulated deficit on its balance sheet.
MicroStrategy (MSTR)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR ) has a WallStreetBets score of 96.
There was a time when I thought Chairman and co-founder Michael Saylor’s strategy of buying Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) for his data analytics software business’s balance sheet wasn’t a terrible idea.
When Saylor started buying BTC in August 2020, the Federal Reserve’s Federal Funds Effective Rate, or FRED, was 0.10% . Today, it’s 5.33%. With cash balances delivering negligible income, it couldn’t hurt to put excess cash into an appreciating asset. Bitcoin at the time was $11,670 . Today, it’s over $58,000.
The company reported its Q1 2024 results on April 29. They missed on both the top and bottom lines. Its shares fell nearly 10% on the news.
In February, I argued that MicroStrategy wasn’t a good data analytics stock because Bitcoin obscured its operating business, which isn’t a high-growth enterprise. Its software-related revenue fell 5.5% in the first quarter to $115.2 million.
The problem is that it went from an operating loss of $20.3 million in Q1 2023 to a $203.7 million loss in the latest quarter. This was because of Bitcoin losses in the three months ended March 31, 2024.
Unlike Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B ), which provides investors with a lower-risk way of owning Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), MicroStrategy does not do the same for Bitcoin.
If you want to own the cryptocurrency, buy it directly or purchase one of the many Bitcoin trusts.
Rumble (RUM)
Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com
Rumble (NASDAQ: RMBL ) has a WallStreetBets score of 63, well below GameStop’s 95 score. I picked Rumble because it’s another example of misguided loyalty to all things Donald Trump.
The good news if you bought RUM stock at the beginning of the year is that you’re up more than 55% year-to-date. The bad news is this is about as good as it will get. The stock got as high as $18.52 in February 2022. It remains well down from its 2022 highs despite this year’s gains.
The gains in 2024 are two-fold: First, the same people gobbling up Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ: DJT ) stock also buy Rumble because of its video partnership with Truth Social, TMTG’s social media platform. Secondly, it signed a partnership with Barstool Sports that puts all of Barstool Sports’ content on the Rumble platform.
“I’m excited about Rumble’s commitment to sports and broadening audiences,” said Dave Portnoy, Founder of Barstool Sports. “With the power of Barstool Sports, we are going to help Rumble be the top player in the video, cloud, and livestreaming space.”
It all sounds terrific. Unfortunately, it doesn’t pay the bills.
In 2023, Rumble generated $81 million , which is a heck of a lot more than Trump Media, but it was flat quarter to quarter while losing nearly $136 million in the past year, or $1.68 per dollar of sales, up from 91 cents per dollar of sales in 2022.
Don’t waste your money.

2024-05-05,Learn How to Profit From Elon Musk's $18 Billion AI Project,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Editor’s Note: This article was previously published under the title, “How to Profit From Elon Musk’s $18 Billion AI Project” but has been updated to include the most recent information.
The global AI Race has begun, and it’s off to a red-hot start. Companies like Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ) and Apple ( AAPL ) – among countless others – are all pouring billions of dollars into this groundbreaking tech.
Why? Because they know that the winner of the AI Race will inevitably become the world’s most powerful company.
But funnily enough, the ultimate winner may not be any of those Big Tech companies.
Rather, it may be a company that you’ve likely never heard of before…
I’m talking about xAI, Elon Musk’s newest AI startup.
A New AI Frontrunner?
About a year ago, Elon Musk set out to create his own AI startup, xAI. He felt that his competitors were all missing the ultimate goal of creating powerful and fair AI. Now, just over a year later, that startup is working to raise $3 billion at an $18 billion valuation.
That is huge growth for a company in just under a year.
But xAI’s growth story could just be getting started.
After all, Apple didn’t become Apple because of the iPhone. It became Apple because of Steve Jobs.
Microsoft didn’t become Microsoft because of Windows. It became Microsoft because of Bill Gates.
World-changing people create world-changing businesses.
So… if you want to invest in world-changing businesses… start by investing in world-changing people.
We certainly believe that Elon Musk is a world-changer.
He co-founded PayPal ( PYPL ), the world’s largest digital payment platform, now worth more than $70 billion…
And SpaceX , the world’s largest private space rocket firm, now worth $180 billion.
He pioneered the world’s largest automaker in Tesla ( TSLA ), which is now worth more than all of the next 10 biggest automakers combined…
And he’s also the man behind Neuralink , The Boring Company , and X .
Musk has influenced how we pay for things, what cars we drive, how we communicate online, how we see space…
I’d venture to say that he is one of the most influential business figures of the past 20 years.
A great example of world-changing.
The Final Word
And now this world-changing person has turned his focus to a new business venture at the heart of possibly the most transformative technology the world has ever seen: AI.
Would you bet against him here?
I don’t think I would.
xAI has already launched an impressive AI chatbot named Grok, which many experts claim stacks up pound-for-pound against ChatGPT. And as we mentioned above, the firm is already in talks to raise $3 billion at an $18 billion valuation.
This latest startup is moving fast. With impressive progress. And the journey is likely just getting started.
Because xAI could be Musk’s biggest venture yet.
And right now, you have an opportunity to invest in it.
Now, not directly, of course – xAI is barely a year old. It is still a private startup.
But we have found a potentially huge “backdoor” investment opportunity into xAI. It’s a stock that you’ve likely have never heard of before, but we think it could be xAI’s leading tech component supplier.
If xAI becomes a champion of the multi-trillion-dollar AI race, then this stock could absolutely soar.
Get all the details about this little-known supplier.

Berkshire Hathaway trimmed its Apple position, which may cause immediate volatility. It's notable that they chose to reduce their stake now.
Apple's massive buyback program is positive news, but given its long-term net-cash neutral goals, it has to proceed with caution, especially given the challenges that lie ahead.
Given these headwinds, valuation models suggest 11–13% downside.
Investment Thesis
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) recently announced its Q2 FY24 earnings results that beat estimates. Two straight takeaways from their earnings report were the hardware devices business not doing as badly as markets estimated and its record share buyback program, which is now on record as the largest ever share repurchase program.
This earnings announcement by Apple almost coincides with Berkshire Hathway’s (NYSE: BRK.B ) own Q1 FY24 earnings results, which showed the holding company had trimmed some of its Apple position....",19

A Federal Court authorized this Notice. This is not a solicitation from a lawyer.
TO: ALL PERSONS OR ENTITIES WHO OR WHICH HELD SHARES OF APPLE INC. (“APPLE” OR THE “COMPANY”) COMMON STOCK AS OF THE CLOSE OF TRADING ON APRIL 29, 2024.
THIS NOTICE RELATES TO THE PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION. PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. IF YOU ARE A CURRENT APPLE SHAREHOLDER, THIS NOTICE CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR RIGHTS.
THIS ACTION IS NOT A “CLASS ACTION.” THUS, THERE IS NO COMMON FUND UPON WHICH YOU CAN MAKE A CLAIM FOR MONETARY PAYMENT. IF YOU DO NOT OBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OR THE AMOUNT OF ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND EXPENSES DESCRIBED IN THIS NOTICE, YOU ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO TAKE ANY ACTION.
The purpose of this Notice is to inform you of: (i) the pendency of the shareholder derivative action brought on behalf of Apple Inc. (“Apple” or the “Company”), styled as In re Apple Inc. Stockholder Derivative Litiga tion , Case No. 4:19-cv-05153-YGR (the “Federal Action”) , pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Oakland Division (the “Federal Court”); the shareholder derivative action brought on behalf of Apple pending in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara (the “California Court”), styled as In re Apple Inc. Stockholder Derivative Litigation , Lead Case No. 19CV355213 (the “California Action”), and a factually-related litigation demand on Apple’s board of directors (the “Demand” and, together with the Federal Action and California Action, the “Actions”); and (ii) a proposed settlement of the Actions (the “Settlement”), subject to approval of the Federal Court.
The terms of the settlement are set forth in an Amended Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise, Settlement, and Release dated April 29, 2024 (the “Amended Stipulation”). 1 This notice should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the text of the Amended Stipulation, which has been filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.

Under the terms of the Amended Stipulation, as a part of the proposed Settlement, Apple will adopt and/or implement corporate governance reforms, which are attached as Exhibit A to the Amended Stipulation (“Enhancements”). All Parties agree the Enhancements confer substantial benefits upon Apple and its shareholders. In addition, Apple’s Board, including each of its independent, non-employee directors (including the members of the DEC), advised by outside counsel for the Company, has unanimously approved a resolution reflecting the Board’s determination, in the good faith exercise of its business judgment, that the Settlement confers substantial benefits upon Apple and its shareholders, and that the Settlement and each of its terms are fair and reasonable and serve the best interests of Apple and its shareholders.
In light of the substantial benefits conferred upon Apple by Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s efforts, Apple shall pay or cause to be paid attorneys’ fees and expenses to Plaintiffs’ Counsel in the agreed amount of $6,000,000 (the “Fee and Expense Amount”), subject to Court approval. Plaintiffs’ Counsel will apply to the Court for service awards of $5,000 (“Service Awards”) to each of the Plaintiffs to be drawn from the Fee and Expense Amount.

However, you shall not be heard at the Settlement Hearing unless you have filed with the Court, no later than July 2, 2024, a written notice of objection containing the following information: (i) clear identification of the case name and case number, In re Apple Inc.

It’s been a very strong year for Berkshire Hathaway as the company moves into its latest annual meeting. This will be Buffett’s 60th meeting since taking the helm in 1965, but as with every annual meeting, investors will find plenty to digest.
Here’s what investors may want to pay closest attention to tomorrow.
Berkshire Hathaway Stock Strong Heading Into Annual Meeting
Among the key questions investors still have with respect to Berkshire Hathaway’s future structure is who exactly will manage what when Buffett eventually passes. Greg Abel manages much of the day-to-day operations at the conglomerate. He currently focuses on the company’s core railroads, energy and other non-insurance businesses. Abel was previously tapped as the next CEO in the company’s succession plan announced in 2021. However, how exactly capital is allocated and by whom remains a question. This has become an even more pertinent question following Munger’s recent passing.
Additionally, Berkshire appears to have made a big purchase in recent months, asking the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to keep this transaction private . Buffett has been much better at holding his cards closer to his vest, with the occasional tip from Munger coming in these meetings. Accordingly, many don’t expect to hear much on this front, but the company’s management team is likely to field some questions on the matter.
Then there’s Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and its recent post-earnings surge. Investors will likely want to gauge how Buffett views the stock now and whether he’s made any big moves.
Overall, it’s set to be an interesting weekend, and this broadcast is likely to be closely watched by Berkshire investors and finance enthusiasts worldwide.

2024-05-03,April Jobs Data Tees Stocks Up for a Strong Summer Rally,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
After several weeks of volatile trading, we’re finally seeing the light at the end of this tunnel. And with fresh ‘Goldilocks’ jobs data now in the mix, we’re even more confident in our call that a massive summer stock rally is just around the corner.
Our conviction stems from a trifecta of bullish developments that indicate stocks are about to rocket higher.
First, we received strong earnings results. Indeed, pretty much every major company from Alphabet ( GOOGL ) to Microsoft ( MSFT ) to Apple ( AAPL ) has reported outstanding quarterly earnings over the past few weeks.
Then, the Federal Reserve reaffirmed its dovish stance. At the FOMC press conference just two days ago, Fed Board Chair Jerome Powell confirmed that the central bank still plans to cut rates later this year. Furthermore, it isn’t considering hiking rates again, especially if the labor market weakens and/or inflation continues to cool.
And just this morning, we received some ‘Goldilocks’ jobs data. The newly released April jobs report suggests that the U.S. labor market is weakening and that inflation is cooling. Overall private-sector job growth slowed to one of its most sluggish paces since the pandemic emerged. Meanwhile, wage growth did, in fact, drop to its slowest pace of the post-pandemic era. And we think these results should compel the Fed to cut rates sooner than most people think.
A Bullish Trifecta Is Building
Strong earnings, a dovish Fed and soft economic data – the trifecta that brings about a huge stock market rally.
And we’re getting all three right now.
It should be no surprise, then, that stocks have been soaring recently. The market rallied triple-digits on Thursday. It is up another triple-digits on Friday as I write.
It seems the stock market is bouncing back to life.
And we believe that throughout the rest of May, we’ll continue to see strong earnings results. That will push forward earnings estimates higher, creating a huge tailwind for stocks.
Moreover, we’ll also likely receive softer inflation reports in May and June as the economy gradually weakens, businesses stop hiking prices (as they’ve mentioned in this quarter’s conference calls), and commodity price pressures ease (oil prices have been crashing lately). The labor market should also continue to cool.
That should lead the Fed to consider rate cuts more seriously, meaning the market’s rate-cut hopes will soar throughout the summer.
And ultimately, we think this saga ends with the Fed actually cutting rates in July – which could unleash a massive stock market rally.
The Final Word on April’s Jobs Data
Net-net, we see “green shoots” for stocks over the next few months as we approach the Fed’s first rate cut, which should accelerate the rally even further.
So, needless to say… we’re feeling very bullish.
That’s why we’ve gone on a buying spree as of late. We’ve been hard at work finding the stocks to best prepare our portfolios for this incoming market rally.
Now that it has arrived, we think our new picks are going to soar.

2024-05-03,Why Are Stocks Up Today?,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Stocks are up today and investors wondering why have come to the right place as we have the latest details behind Friday’s rally!
One of the reasons stocks are up today comes from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). The tech giant announced a massive $110 billion share buyback alongside its first-quarter earnings report. The company also increased its quarterly dividend at the same time.
That did a lot to boost investor hopes in the company, as iPhone sales slowed during the quarter. Even so, Apple managed to beat out Wall Street’s EPS and revenue estimates for the period.
Another reason why stocks are up today has to do with the latest job report . That report came in soft, which is a sign that inflation may be starting to slow. This has reignited hopes that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates as a result.
Let’s check out how these stories are affecting the major stock indices below!

2024-05-03,DJT Stock Alert: SEC Charges Trump Media Auditor With 'Massive Fraud',"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Trump Media & Technology (NASDAQ: DJT ) stock is in the news Friday after the auditor BF Borgers CPA was hit with charges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The charges against the auditor and its owner include “massive” amounts of fraud that affect more than 1,500 SEC filings. The SEC claims the firm took part in “deliberate and systemic failures to comply with [the] Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.”
In response to this, BF Borgers CPA and its owner Benjamin Borgers have agreed to a permanent suspension of their accounting practices. They also agreed to pay $14 million in civil penalties connected to the fraud charges.
What This Means for DJT Stock
Considering the allegations against BF Borgers CPA, some investors are wondering about the financials of Trump Media & Technology. That makes sense, as the company decided to keep the firm as its auditor through 2024 earlier this year.
This also ties back to the company’s public debut earlier this year, when it combined with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Digital World Acquisition to go public. The two had been working on this merger since 2021. The SEC’s charges against BF Borgers CPA state that its false filings happened between 2021 and 2023, CNBC notes.
Today’s news has DJT stock down 3.8% as of Friday morning.

2024-05-03,Why Apple Stock Jumped on Friday,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock popped in early trading on Friday, helping lift the entire market higher as well. The tech giant accounts for an outsized portion of the broader earnings of the S&P 500 , making it among the most closely watched companies when earnings season rolls around. It also helps that the iPhone maker's market capitalization sits near $3 trillion.
Apple didn't disappoint investors with its late-Thursday earnings update. While sales declined, the slump was modest. And CEO Tim Cook and his team had some good news for investors to offset that sales weakness.
Revenue landed at $91 billion, down from $95 billion a year ago. The iPhone business was the main reason for this drop , as consumers were cautious in their upgrade commitments following the launch of the iPhone 15. Apple collected $46 billion from iPhone sales this quarter, down from $51 billion a year ago.",20

2024-05-03,AAPL Shares Pop on $110 Billion Apple Stock Buyback Plans,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock is getting a boost on Friday after the tech giant announced a $110 billion share buyback problem.
This AAPL stock buyback program was announced alongside the company’s earnings report for the second quarter of 2024. To go along with that, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 4% to 25 cents.
Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said the following about the stock buyback and dividend:
“Given our confidence in Apple’s future and the value we see in our stock, our Board has authorized an additional $110 billion for share repurchases. We are also raising our quarterly dividend for the twelfth year in a row.”
Apple also reported EPS of $1.53 alongside revenue of $90.75 billion. Both of these are better than Wall Street’s estimates of $1.51 per share and revenue of $90.45 billion. For comparison, the company’s performance a year ago was EPS of $1.52 and revenue of $94.84 billion.
AAPL Stock Deep Dive
Investors will note that Apple’s stock buyback and dividend are easing investors’ worries about slowing sales. The company saw iPhone sales of $45.96 billion come in just under estimates .
It’s also worth noting that iPad revenue for the quarter was $5.6 billion. That’s down 17% from the same period of the year prior. However, Mac sales increased 4% to $7.5 billion during the quarter.
AAPL stock is up 6.3% as of Friday morning. That comes with more than 58 million shares traded. This is closing in on its daily average of about 61.5 million shares.

2024-05-03,2 Tech Stocks For Your May 2024 Watchlist,"The technology sector is a dynamic component of the stock market, characterized by companies involved in electronics, software, computers, artificial intelligence, and other technological innovations. This sector is popular among investors due to its potential for high growth and innovation-driven gains. Tech companies range from giants like Amazon ( NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Netflix ( NASDAQ: NFLX ) to smaller startups, providing a broad spectrum of investment opportunities.
Investing in tech stocks offers several advantages, such as the potential for substantial growth and exposure to innovative products and services that can transform industries. Many tech companies are at the forefront of advancements like cloud computing and AI, driving new market opportunities. However, there are also disadvantages, including high volatility and valuation concerns. Tech stocks can be highly susceptible to market sentiment, regulatory changes, and economic shifts, leading to significant price fluctuations.
Overall, buying tech stocks requires careful consideration of risk tolerance and market trends. While the sector offers opportunities for significant returns, it demands close attention to company fundamentals and broader technological trends.

Investors in Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A , NYSE: BRK-B ) certainly have plenty to consider as we head into what will be a big weekend. Berkshire Hathaway stock is nearing its record high, as investors digest what may be announced in the company’s upcoming annual meeting .
This meeting will take place tomorrow, May 4, with the notable absence of Charlie Munger who recently passed away. There will certainly be plenty of commentary from CEO Warren Buffett about the passing of his lifelong business partner at age 99, with a tribute expected to generate an emotional response from the crowd.
It’s been a very strong year for Berkshire Hathaway as the company moves into its latest annual meeting. This will be Buffett’s 60th meeting since taking the helm in 1965, but as with every annual meeting, investors will find plenty to digest.
Here’s what investors may want to pay closest attention to tomorrow.
Berkshire Hathaway Stock Strong Heading Into Annual Meeting
Among the key questions investors still have with respect to Berkshire Hathaway’s future structure is who exactly will manage what when Buffett eventually passes. Greg Abel manages much of the day-to-day operations at the conglomerate. He currently focuses on the company’s core railroads, energy and other non-insurance businesses. Abel was previously tapped as the next CEO in the company’s succession plan announced in 2021. However, how exactly capital is allocated and by whom remains a question. This has become an even more pertinent question following Munger’s recent passing.
Additionally, Berkshire appears to have made a big purchase in recent months, asking the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to keep this transaction private . Buffett has been much better at holding his cards closer to his vest, with the occasional tip from Munger coming in these meetings. Accordingly, many don’t expect to hear much on this front, but the company’s management team is likely to field some questions on the matter.
Then there’s Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and its recent post-earnings surge. Investors will likely want to gauge how Buffett views the stock now and whether he’s made any big moves.
Overall, it’s set to be an interesting weekend, and this broadcast is likely to be closely watched by Berkshire investors and finance enthusiasts worldwide.

2024-05-03,April Jobs Data Tees Stocks Up for a Strong Summer Rally,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
After several weeks of volatile trading, we’re finally seeing the light at the end of this tunnel. And with fresh ‘Goldilocks’ jobs data now in the mix, we’re even more confident in our call that a massive summer stock rally is just around the corner.
Our conviction stems from a trifecta of bullish developments that indicate stocks are about to rocket higher.
First, we received strong earnings results. Indeed, pretty much every major company from Alphabet ( GOOGL ) to Microsoft ( MSFT ) to Apple ( AAPL ) has reported outstanding quarterly earnings over the past few weeks.
Then, the Federal Reserve reaffirmed its dovish stance. At the FOMC press conference just two days ago, Fed Board Chair Jerome Powell confirmed that the central bank still plans to cut rates later this year. Furthermore, it isn’t considering hiking rates again, especially if the labor market weakens and/or inflation continues to cool.
And just this morning, we received some ‘Goldilocks’ jobs data. The newly released April jobs report suggests that the U.S. labor market is weakening and that inflation is cooling. Overall private-sector job growth slowed to one of its most sluggish paces since the pandemic emerged. Meanwhile, wage growth did, in fact, drop to its slowest pace of the post-pandemic era. And we think these results should compel the Fed to cut rates sooner than most people think.
A Bullish Trifecta Is Building
Strong earnings, a dovish Fed and soft economic data – the trifecta that brings about a huge stock market rally.
And we’re getting all three right now.
It should be no surprise, then, that stocks have been soaring recently. The market rallied triple-digits on Thursday. It is up another triple-digits on Friday as I write.
It seems the stock market is bouncing back to life.
And we believe that throughout the rest of May, we’ll continue to see strong earnings results. That will push forward earnings estimates higher, creating a huge tailwind for stocks.
Moreover, we’ll also likely receive softer inflation reports in May and June as the economy gradually weakens, businesses stop hiking prices (as they’ve mentioned in this quarter’s conference calls), and commodity price pressures ease (oil prices have been crashing lately). The labor market should also continue to cool.
That should lead the Fed to consider rate cuts more seriously, meaning the market’s rate-cut hopes will soar throughout the summer.
And ultimately, we think this saga ends with the Fed actually cutting rates in July – which could unleash a massive stock market rally.
The Final Word on April’s Jobs Data
Net-net, we see “green shoots” for stocks over the next few months as we approach the Fed’s first rate cut, which should accelerate the rally even further.
So, needless to say… we’re feeling very bullish.
That’s why we’ve gone on a buying spree as of late. We’ve been hard at work finding the stocks to best prepare our portfolios for this incoming market rally.
Now that it has arrived, we think our new picks are going to soar.

Stocks are up today and investors wondering why have come to the right place as we have the latest details behind Friday’s rally!
One of the reasons stocks are up today comes from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). The tech giant announced a massive $110 billion share buyback alongside its first-quarter earnings report. The company also increased its quarterly dividend at the same time.
That did a lot to boost investor hopes in the company, as iPhone sales slowed during the quarter. Even so, Apple managed to beat out Wall Street’s EPS and revenue estimates for the period.
Another reason why stocks are up today has to do with the latest job report . That report came in soft, which is a sign that inflation may be starting to slow. This has reignited hopes that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates as a result.
Let’s check out how these stories are affecting the major stock indices below!

2024-05-03,DJT Stock Alert: SEC Charges Trump Media Auditor With 'Massive Fraud',"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Trump Media & Technology (NASDAQ: DJT ) stock is in the news Friday after the auditor BF Borgers CPA was hit with charges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The charges against the auditor and its owner include “massive” amounts of fraud that affect more than 1,500 SEC filings. The SEC claims the firm took part in “deliberate and systemic failures to comply with [the] Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.”
In response to this, BF Borgers CPA and its owner Benjamin Borgers have agreed to a permanent suspension of their accounting practices. They also agreed to pay $14 million in civil penalties connected to the fraud charges.
What This Means for DJT Stock
Considering the allegations against BF Borgers CPA, some investors are wondering about the financials of Trump Media & Technology. That makes sense, as the company decided to keep the firm as its auditor through 2024 earlier this year.
This also ties back to the company’s public debut earlier this year, when it combined with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Digital World Acquisition to go public. The two had been working on this merger since 2021. The SEC’s charges against BF Borgers CPA state that its false filings happened between 2021 and 2023, CNBC notes.
Today’s news has DJT stock down 3.8% as of Friday morning.

2024-05-03,Why Apple Stock Jumped on Friday,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock popped in early trading on Friday, helping lift the entire market higher as well. The tech giant accounts for an outsized portion of the broader earnings of the S&P 500 , making it among the most closely watched companies when earnings season rolls around. It also helps that the iPhone maker's market capitalization sits near $3 trillion.
Apple didn't disappoint investors with its late-Thursday earnings update. While sales declined, the slump was modest. And CEO Tim Cook and his team had some good news for investors to offset that sales weakness.
Revenue landed at $91 billion, down from $95 billion a year ago. The iPhone business was the main reason for this drop , as consumers were cautious in their upgrade commitments following the launch of the iPhone 15.

2024-05-03,Is Cirrus Logic A Good Buy Ahead Of Its Q4 Results?,"Cirrus Logic is a fabless semiconductor company primarily known for its audio components for mobile and consumer markets.
The company will publish its Q4 results on May 7.
We pick out some of the key earnings-related themes.
We close with some thoughts on why CRUS may not make a good buy at this juncture.
Company Profile And Performance
Cirrus Logic, Inc. ( CRUS ), is a mid-cap fabless semiconductor stock, primarily noted for its expertise in providing low-power, low-latency audio components (items such as codecs, digital signal processors, digital/analog converters, etc) for the mobile and consumer markets.

2024-05-03,AAPL Shares Pop on $110 Billion Apple Stock Buyback Plans,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock is getting a boost on Friday after the tech giant announced a $110 billion share buyback problem.
This AAPL stock buyback program was announced alongside the company’s earnings report for the second quarter of 2024. To go along with that, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 4% to 25 cents.
Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said the following about the stock buyback and dividend:
“Given our confidence in Apple’s future and the value we see in our stock, our Board has authorized an additional $110 billion for share repurchases. We are also raising our quarterly dividend for the twelfth year in a row.”
Apple also reported EPS of $1.53 alongside revenue of $90.75 billion. Both of these are better than Wall Street’s estimates of $1.51 per share and revenue of $90.45 billion. For comparison, the company’s performance a year ago was EPS of $1.52 and revenue of $94.84 billion.
AAPL Stock Deep Dive
Investors will note that Apple’s stock buyback and dividend are easing investors’ worries about slowing sales. The company saw iPhone sales of $45.96 billion come in just under estimates .
It’s also worth noting that iPad revenue for the quarter was $5.6 billion. That’s down 17% from the same period of the year prior. However, Mac sales increased 4% to $7.5 billion during the quarter.
AAPL stock is up 6.3% as of Friday morning. That comes with more than 58 million shares traded. This is closing in on its daily average of about 61.5 million shares.

2024-05-03,2 Tech Stocks For Your May 2024 Watchlist,"The technology sector is a dynamic component of the stock market, characterized by companies involved in electronics, software, computers, artificial intelligence, and other technological innovations. This sector is popular among investors due to its potential for high growth and innovation-driven gains. Tech companies range from giants like Amazon ( NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Netflix ( NASDAQ: NFLX ) to smaller startups, providing a broad spectrum of investment opportunities.
Investing in tech stocks offers several advantages, such as the potential for substantial growth and exposure to innovative products and services that can transform industries. Many tech companies are at the forefront of advancements like cloud computing and AI, driving new market opportunities. However, there are also disadvantages, including high volatility and valuation concerns. Tech stocks can be highly susceptible to market sentiment, regulatory changes, and economic shifts, leading to significant price fluctuations.
Overall, buying tech stocks requires careful consideration of risk tolerance and market trends. While the sector offers opportunities for significant returns, it demands close attention to company fundamentals and broader technological trends. Investors should be prepared for potential rapid changes in both technology and stock prices. With that, here are two tech stocks to watch in the stock market today.

The fund yields 9.48%, attracting investors seeking high yields from common equity funds.
However, the fund's share price performance has declined significantly compared to the MSCI World Index, raising concerns about long-term returns.
The fund has generally underperformed the MSCI World Index over time, and it failed to fully cover its distributions over the past two years.
The fund is highly exposed to the United States, so investors who want a high level of foreign exposure would be best served by looking elsewhere.
The Allspring Global Dividend Opportunity Fund ( EOD ) is a closed-end fund that income-focused investors can employ as a method of achieving their goal of providing themselves with a very high level of current income from the assets that are in their portfolios. As the name of the fund suggests, this fund invests primarily in common equities, so potential investors do not need to sacrifice the capital gains potential that these securities possess. The fund should also do a better job of protecting its holders against the ravages of inflation than a fixed-income closed-end fund, which is something that will undoubtedly be appealing in today’s monetary and fiscal environment. After all, recent inflation data shows that the month-over-month movements in the consumer price index have been getting worse over the past few months:

2024-04-30,3 AI Stocks That Could Make You a Fortune (If You Dare),"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
From the working class anticipating joblessness to the financial analysts predicting a market takeover by artificial intelligence ( AI ) stocks, the algorithmic revolution has been historic. AI tech has seen such explosive growth that some financial analysts might tell you that you are already too late to benefit from investing in AI stocks .
Don’t panic though, the views regarding AI’s application and usefulness are still polarized, and many technology companies have very recently jumped into this new space. So, if you are someone who believes sometimes riskier investments can do wonders in terms of making significant wealth, then here are the three AI stocks that could make you a fortune.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is a multinational company specializing in manufacturing and selling of consumer technology products. As of April 2024, Apple is the second-largest company in the world according to its market cap valuation of $2.61 rillion. The stock price has experienced a downward spiral in the past year. However, Yahoo Finance analysts have an average one-year price target of around $199 , which is 17.62% higher than the current trading value of $169.30.
There is no denying that Apple’s past year has not been great in terms of its performance in the market, primarily owing to the decreasing demand for iPhones. However, Apple’s backfooting in the AI realm has kept investors confused. But that’s over now as Apple finally sets to unveil its artificial intelligence system named ReALM , which is said to be more powerful than the OpenAI’s GPT-4.
The stock lost around 15% of its value in the past four months, but the company anticipates a strong recovery with the launch of its language processing model along with the release of the new iOS 18. On the brighter side, the stock trades at 25x forward earnings , which makes the stock further stand out ahead of a potential AI-tech drop.
Nvidia (NVDA)
Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) is currently the largest chip and graphics processing unit (GPU) manufacturer in the world. The chipmaker really surprised the industry by showing off a massive 223% stock price growth within the past year. However, the more surprising fact is the current price sits closer to the lower valuation of $478.40 as compared to the highest valuation of $2,762 . This means there is likely ample room upwards.
Being the backbone of any hardcore computer processing power, the manufacturer has quite strategically positioned itself where a lot of AI propagation is dependent on its hardware and software components. Moreover, the recent acquisition of Israel-based Run:ai places the chipmaker at the forefront of the artificial intelligence race.
Even if the future of the company is not certain in the AI realm itself, the company has earned analysts’ trust. For the past two months, the stock has been among the strongest buying recommendations. Rightly so, with the stock trading at only 36x forward earnings , and a massive growth estimate of over 450%. Thus, it puts this AI stock among investor favorites.
Broadcom (AVGO)
Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com
Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO ) is a semiconductor and chip manufacturer founded back in 1961. It is one of those companies that only a few investors knew about but recently caught attention as the company aims to outshine its largest rival in the ongoing AI revolution. As of now, the average price target sits at $1,522 , which is already over 13% higher than the current valuation of $1344.
Broadcom is quite a reputable company when it comes to the manufacturing of mobile phone chipsets. AI scalability and further expansion are highly dependent on the efficiency of the hardware, and that’s where Broadcom is establishing its footing. With the mantra “ Open, Scalable, Power Efficient ”, the chipmaker is focused on enabling consumer AI .
Due to growing demand for AI, the silicon merchant estimates 35% of total revenue , or $10 billion, comes from AI products. The chipmaker enjoyed massive share price growth of 135% in the past year with earnings per share growing over 25% . The stock trades at just 28x forward earnings. Given its huge successes, AVGO stock should be a hot pick for investors wanting exposure in the AI realm.

2024-04-30,Nike: Trust The Brand Equity,"Nike boasts robust brand equity and holds a dominant position in an industry that is poised for sustained growth.
The new CEO is prioritizing innovation through a multiyear cycle.
Early indications suggest that the new management is preparing the company for a new phase of solid growth.
Investment thesis
Nike (NKE) boasts robust brand equity and holds a dominant position in an industry that is poised for sustained growth, with more than double the sales of its closest competitor. The company is facing several headwinds, some of which are temporary and others that will take longer to address as it reassesses its business model and growth algorithm looking ahead. Yet, all the discussion around Nike boils down to whether the company can sustain its brand equity, a key competitive advantage that has historically been built upon innovation, which, in turn, creates the foundation of the new strategy encompassing a multiyear innovation cycle. The company's history is marked by periods of innovation cycles, with growth first accelerating and then moderating over time. While past success does not guarantee future results, there seems to be indications that the new management is preparing the company for a new phase of growth; scheduling an Investor Day later this year (the first time in a while) to unveil its next five-year plan, along with generating excitement in Paris ahead of the Olympics by showcasing a glimpse of its innovation pipeline, may suggest this notion. With the stock trading near its 52-week lows, and with modest consensus expectations for FY24E (when margins are expected to bottom) and FY25E (with top-line growing low-single-digit and with EPS already revised down by ~-20% since the start of 2023), for those with patience and a belief that the company is entering a new cycle of growth, I believe now could be an opportune moment to consider looking at the name, and possibly be rewarded in the future.
Nike faces near-term headwinds and increased competition
Nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear (65% of sales) and apparel (27% of sales) globally. The company sells its products through 1,000+ owned stores (20% of sales), followed by its digital platform NIKE Brand Digital (24% of sales), and wholesale customers (56% of sales). Nike's operations span nearly all countries worldwide, with North America ((NA)) accounting for 42% of sales, followed by Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) at 26%, China at 14%, and Asia/Latin America at 13%....",21

2024-04-29,Here's How Much Stock Apple Repurchased in the Past Year,"Most investors focus on a company's growth prospects when considering a purchase of its stock. And understandably so. Revenue and earnings growth isn't the only way to add to a stock's value, however.
Reducing the number of outstanding shares of a company is another, often-overlooked means of making existing shareholders' stakes worth more. The company in question simply needs to repurchase shares of itself in the open market and then take them out of circulation.
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been one of the more prominent names embracing this idea. Although it pays a dividend, it's opting to reward investors by buying shares of itself rather than raising its dividend payouts. Over the course of the past four reported quarters, Apple has shelled out $78.1 billion to repurchase 456 million shares of its own stock. For perspective, Apple's current market capitalization stands at $2.6 trillion, and it's got nearly 15.58 billion outstanding shares.",21

It has been some month of April for members of the famous ""Magnificent 7.""

This earnings season has been as wild as any, with moves of 10% or more in these stocks routinely following their earnings releases after market close. And those moves seem to have confused many on Wall Street, with strong fundamental reports met with selling pressure, or the opposite. And we're not done with Mag 7 earnings season yet.

I didn't want to write this article the night of Meta Platforms ( META ) earnings because I wanted to see how the week ended. I am not surprised in the slightest that shares have already started to rebound, as the massive price decline was an overreaction. Shares of META went into the earnings call down -12% and continued falling into the -16% range as Mark Zuckerberg focused heavily on CapEx spending. At one point, shares flirted with breaking through the $400 level and had a fifth of the market cap evaporate in less than an hour. The individuals selling after hours didn't even have time to digest earnings or listen to the call, which I believe will be a mistake. META has been on a phenomenal run, and I can't fault anyone for taking a profit, but after going through the earnings report and the commentary from the conference call, I believe there is a lot of room for shares of META to run going forward....",21

2024-04-29,Apple Earnings Preview: Is AAPL Stock a Buy Ahead of the May 2 Report?,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Down roughly 10% to start the year, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock investors remain on edge. The smartphone maker faces key challenges before their upcoming earnings report on May 2. Despite weakness in iPhone sales in China and regulatory scrutiny, price target of $225 from Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ) shows room for positivity.
The company plans to showcase more of its generative AI features in its iOS. However, investors are worried about the costs associated with this AI rollout.
Apple investors also expect a significant May 7 event that could boost stock performance. Although the company has not disclosed any more specific information on the event, the public expects it could be a launch of new iPads. Apple has seen no updates on the said gadgets since 2022, and many are expecting news on this front.
Let’s dive more into what to expect with this upcoming report, and what investors will be watching.
Earnings Report and AAPL Stock
Seeing lower revenues in recent quarters, Wall Street’s expectations for Apple are not too high this time around. As actual results will be released on May 2, such forecasts and expectations could lead to significant price moves for AAPL stock.
If Apple exceeds expectations, the stock will go up. If it does not meet the forecasts, stock prices could decline precipitously.
However, Apple’s earnings per share may surprise to the upside. Experts anticipate that Apple will report $1.51 earnings per share year over year and revenue of $89 billion.
If these numbers are exceeded, and management issues strong guidance, the stock could head higher. Indeed, there’s plenty of pessimism baked into the company’s current estimates.
Over the past 30 days, the quarter’s consensus earnings per share estimate was revised higher by 0.38%. This indicates a collective reassessment by covering analysts, and suggests the market believes the company could be in line to report a beat.
50% Forecast for Vision Pro Cut
On the bearish side of the ledger, Apple recently reduced its shipment target for its Vision Pro by roughly 50%. Estimates dropped to approximately 500,000 units from the initial estimate of 800,000 units. A significant demand decline in the U.S. contributed to these cuts.
Apple may skip a second-generation Vision Pro in 2025, contrary to what analysts initially expected. Initially planning around 400,000 units in 2024, Apple raised its potential target before reducing it.
This product, which many saw as pivotal to the company’s success, appears to have become a niche offering that’s not seeing the kind of uptake many initially thought.
Sales Drop in China
Counterpoint Research recently reported a significant 19.1% decline in Apple’s iPhone sales in China during the year’s first quarter. This drop was attributed to intense competition from Huawei, which experienced a resurgence in its smartphone business.
The research also showed that over 69% of Huawei’s smartphone sales surge was driven by the launch of its newest Mate 60 model with advanced 5G tech.
Although sanctions have hampered its business, Huawei’s comeback is unprecedented, and it has become the fourth-largest smartphone maker in China alone. This puts pressure on Apple, which stands as the third-largest.
Ivan Lam, a senior research analyst at Counterpoint Research, stated that Huawei’s resurgence affected Apple’s sales, particularly in the premium segment. Replacement demand for Apple was also lower.
Lam suggested Apple might rebound in China with new color options, discounts, and AI features, which are expected at WWDC in June.
Stay Cautious With AAPL Stock
Regulatory challenges are clouding Apple’s outlook, and there’s plenty of demand-related concern in the market to justify a lower valuation.
Thus, even though AAPL stock is down this year, it’s a stock that could have even more downside in the coming months. I wouldn’t trade this stock at current levels and tilt slightly bearish over the near-term.
That said, I do remain a longer-term bull on Apple. So, the view for me is mixed. I think it’s possible to be bearish in the short-term and optimistic over the long-run.
Ultimately, if Apple does see its multiple decline to something like 20-times earnings (either via earnings growth or stock price pressure), this will be a stock to back the truck up on. Until then, I think investors can be patient with Apple.

In this monthly series, we present how to select the right kind of stocks for options income. We present two lists of 10 stocks with multiple scenarios: Put options and deep-in-the-money call options.
Author's Note: This article is part of our periodic/monthly series that attempts to present two lists of stocks for the month that could be suitable for writing options to generate relatively safe income. Certain parts of the introduction, definitions, and section describing the selection process will have some commonality and repetitiveness with our previous articles in this series. This is unavoidable as well as intentional to keep the entire series consistent and easy to follow for new readers. Such sections are presented in 'italics.' Regular readers who follow the series from month to month could skip such sections.
Why This Monthly Options Series?
Earning a decent income from your investments significantly higher than the inflation rate is always challenging. This has been especially true in the past decade and a half. More recently, the interest rates have gone up, but in most cases, the fixed deposit rates are still lower than the inflation rate. Furthermore, interest rates are going to decline going forward. Investing in fundamentally strong dividend stocks is an excellent choice for building long-term wealth, but not so much for the current income. We believe selling options (cash-covered puts and covered calls) remain a relatively good choice for earning a high current income. Obviously, there is some learning curve, and there are some risks involved with options, and we do not recommend blindly jumping into the game. We will discuss how to mitigate the risks in a bit.

2024-04-28,Hold On Tight to Tesla Stock or Bail Out? Let's Decode Musk's Latest Promises.,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Investor’s Business Daily published an article on April 24 discussing the 10 S&P 500 stocks with the largest losses in market capitalization in 2024. In the second spot is Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) stock, with a loss of $328 billion or 42%. The only name ahead of Tesla stock is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), which has lost $433 billion.
Investors question if Musk’s offer to fast-track cheaper EVs was a tactic to halt losses. After investors stop selling, he’ll focus on robotaxis and other unconventional ideas again.  Is Tesla stock still a good investment without an affordable electric vehicle? I’ll look at both sides of the argument.
Is a Model 2-Like EV Necessary?
I have always wondered why Tesla bothered with the Cybertruck. Its contentious design would ensure that it never gained a place in most American driveways.
With EV sales in a holding pattern, the Cybertruck looks even sillier. I’m not even talking about the recent recall of nearly 4,000 of them — all the Cybertrucks sold since their launch last February — because of a sticky accelerator.
There were so many vehicles he could have built instead of the Cybertruck, the most obvious being the Model 2. But he didn’t, and now its share price faces a challenging uphill climb.
While the Model 2 is dead , Musk crossed his heart and swore to die that cheaper EVs would be here ahead of its original 2H2025 launch date. The only problem is there needs to be details about what these vehicles will look like or sell for.
According to reporting from CarScoops.com, a survey by GBK Collective of 2,000 Americans found over half were looking to buy either a BEV (battery electric vehicle), PHEV (plug-in hybrid vehicle) or HEV (hybrid electric vehicle) for their next purchase.
That’s the good news. The bad news for Tesla stock is that consumers plan to be far more discriminant than previous buyers.
“The study learned that this new potential customer group only had a median budget of $50,000 for their next vehicle, whereas current EV owners were shopping with a $59,000 kitty,” stated CarScoops.com contributor Chris Chilton.
On the surface, many buyers might be OK with a Model 3 or something similar, making a Model 2 redundant.
The Biggest Problem With the Status Quo
Tesla has already sold vehicles to most prospective buyers without concerns about price. Selling to the next cohort will be much more challenging.
An October 2023 article from Bloomberg pointed out that with the recent price cuts, the base Model 3 sold for just under $39,000 , well under the survey respondent’s $50,000 budget. Further, the Model Y was selling for around $44,300, $3,700 below the average sale price for a new vehicle in the U.S.
So, right there, these buyers have two Tesla vehicles already within their price range, so what’s holding them back?
For starters, higher interest rates and inflation have consumers thinking long and hard about big-ticket items such as EV purchases. While someone in a survey says they’ll spend $50,000 on some type of EV as their next purchase, when push comes to shove, it will be tough for them to part with the money without getting a significant deal.
They’ll want considerable bang for their buck to give up their gas-powered vehicle for something electric, knowing that EV sales have slowed considerably.
If Tesla brought out a vehicle that slots between the Model Y/Model 3 and Model X/Model S, it could lure these survey respondents into purchasing.
The Model 3 isn’t moving them from tire kickers to buyers.
The Bottom Line on Tesla Stock
Elon Musk continues to push software-related products to maintain its technology valuation rather than just become another car company.
It cut its FSD (full self-driving) software package by 33% to $8,000 and the monthly subscription price from $199 to $99, which is reasonable considering inflation. But I digress.
I don’t know where I read it, but I saw an estimate the other day that FSD is in 10% of all Tesla vehicles and is rising quickly.
While it doesn’t hurt to have this recurring revenue, the name of the game is still to sell as many vehicles as possible. Tesla has spent billions to develop its five models. To say it’s not an automaker is to deny its heritage and reason for being.
If you own Tesla stock, I’d continue to hold. If you don’t, I’d be in no hurry to buy its stock. Let this latest strategy change play out first.

In total, there are nearly four dozen stocks in which the conglomerate has a stake.
You'll quickly realize, however, that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) makes up 41% of the entire portfolio. That position has been driven by impressive share-price gains. Warren Buffett first purchased this "" Magnificent Seven "" stock in the first quarter of 2016. Since the start of that year to today, Apple is up a jaw-dropping 542%.

2024-04-27,The Top 3 AI Stocks to Buy in April 2024,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Broader stock markets are getting slammed this month.
But investors finally have a shot at buying, at better prices, the same AI stocks that enjoyed breakthrough Q1 rallies. Those with long-term mindsets could get more value as they pursue the market’s most intriguing AI plays. This could prove profitable while they’re on the descent.
Following are three of the less obvious AI stocks. They may become considerably undervalued the longer this market wide sell-off goes. As AI euphoria dies down, dip-buyers may be treated to another AI rally at some point down the line.
Meta Platforms (META)

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) stock was demolished following its impressive first-quarter earnings results. It saw an impressive earnings beat with some cautious guidance. Indeed, investors probably wanted to see hiked guidance, not caution , ahead of its next (second) quarter. The more than 15% after-hours crash in META stock could prove a prime opportunity.
With Meta AI’s rather quiet launch, META is one of the best value stocks amid the long-term AI uprising. During the Q1 conference call, Zuckerberg was quick to shift focus to the long-term game. He spoke about its big bets on AI as well as the metaverse.
Indeed, META has been riding high on the back of AI. So some investors may have forgotten a core fact. Meta Platforms is a metaverse company, perhaps one of the best-positioned to thrive. With shares at $440 per share, META is a great bargain that’s misunderstood.
Apple (AAPL)

Speaking of misunderstood companies, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) doesn’t get enough credit. True, the company hasn’t launched its language model quite yet. And it’s been more than a year after ChatGPT changed the world as we know it. Some of the Apple bears may think Apple is behind in AI. Others may think the firm has no AI coming at all.
With Wednesday’s open-source release of OpenELM , Apple’s efficient language model, it’s about time to stop the harsh AI criticisms. The company has been contributing a great deal to the open-source AI community lately. Furthermore, it’s been super busy buying up AI startups.
The widely anticipated iOS 18 is rumored to be full of AI features and maybe a Siri successor. But it is still many months away. The stock continues to stand out as a potential value buy ahead of a pipeline of AI innovations. And those could change the public’s view of the iPhone maker.
Nvidia (NVDA)
Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com
Waiting for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) stock to cool off so that you can get a better price? Well, you may finally have a shot to punch a ticket to Jensen Huang’s GPU empire, with shares slipping over 16% off their recent highs.
With a potential “Blackwell boom”, the recent acquisition of Israel-based Run:ai is reported to be worth around $700 million. So, it’s becoming harder to sell NVDA stock on the latest bout of market weakness.
Indeed, the latest AI acquisition has me incredibly excited about the road ahead. Jensen Huang knows where the puck is headed next in AI. With this latest deal, Nvidia seems to have bolstered its AI workload management and optimization capabilities.
As we march forward, running AI models efficiently may be just as important as the maximum potential horsepower of the latest accelerators. With that, I think Nvidia is already on the right track.

2024-04-26,Tech's Biggest Comeback? 3 Stocks to Buy for the Epic Rebound.,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
A lot of technology stocks are battered and bruised. Many once high-flying mega-cap tech stocks are taking it on the chin. This week, shares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) are down more than 10% after the tech giant issued disappointing guidance and mounting losses at its new ventures unit, Reality Labs. With interest rates expected to remain high for the foreseeable future, tech stocks seem particularly vulnerable to a downturn right now.
In recent weeks, entire subsectors of tech have moved lower, notably stocks of companies working in the areas of semiconductors, artificial intelligence ( AI ) and cybersecurity. How long the current downturn lasts is anyone’s guess. That said, there are some tech stocks that are showing tentative signs of recovery and could be poised for a turnaround in coming months, driven by earnings and other catalysts. Here are three tech stocks to buy in anticipation of an epic rebound.
Tesla (TSLA)
Source: kovop / Shutterstock.com
Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) is by no means out of the woods. The electric vehicle maker just reported its biggest revenue decline since 2012 and its first-quarter profit plunged 55% from a year earlier. That said, the worst of the selloff in TSLA stock appears to be over. In the two days since the company’s Q1 print, Tesla’s share price has risen 13%. The stock now looks to have bottomed at $138. Investors looking to bottom fish Tesla might want to buy the stock now.
A lot is riding on the company’s ability to bring a more affordable electric vehicle to market by early 2025, as CEO Elon Musk promised during the Q1 earnings call with analysts and media. Cost controls and plans to cut 10% of Tesla’s workforce will also be important, as is the ability to license its driver assistance system to other automakers. If Musk and his management team can pull it all off, then Tesla could prove to be one great comeback story. In the meantime, TSLA stock is trending upwards.
Texas Instruments (TXN)
Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com
Among semiconductor stocks , Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN ) has been a long-term laggard. In the last five years, TXN stock has risen 50%. Compare that to Nvidia’s (NASDAQ: NVDA ) 1,817% gain over the same period. While disappointing, Texas Instruments looks like it might be starting to get its mojo back after years of chronic underperformance. The company’s share price rose 7% in a day after the legacy tech concern reported better-than-expected financial results for Q1 of this year.
Texas Instruments reported earnings per share ( EPS ) of $1.20, which was much better than Wall Street forecasts of $1.07. Revenue during the first three months of the year came in at $3.66 billion, also ahead of analyst estimates of $3.6 billion. In terms of guidance , Texas Instruments forecast Q2 revenue of $3.65 billion to $3.95 billion, and profits of $1.05 to $1.25 per share. The Q2 guidance aligns with Wall Street forecasts.
Apple (AAPL)

It might not be long before consumer electronics giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stages an epic rebound. In 2024, AAPL stock is one of the worst performers among tech securities. So far this year, Apple’s share price is down nearly 9%, and a laggard in the benchmark S&P 500 index. However, there are potential catalysts looming on the horizon. All eyes will be on the company’s May 2 earnings report. People will also be watching a May 7 event where Apple is expected to unveil a revamped version of its iPad tablet.
Apple’s signature tablet, the iPad, launched in 2010 and has not been significantly updated since 2018. A new iPad could help to boost sales of the device, which declined 25% to $7.02 billion in this year’s first quarter, according to industry estimates. Sales across all Apple products have suffered amid economic uncertainty and as consumers cutback on spending. Revitalizing its electronic devices could boost sales and AAPL stock. Unveiling AI applications at its developers conference in June could also help.

2024-04-26,Trump Media Stock's Wild Ride: Should You Jump on Board or Steer Clear?,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ: DJT ) stock, the Donald Trump media project that recently went public to much fanfare, has the tumultuous nature of meme stock. Shares soared on their first availability, then plunged, but are starting to rise once more.
None of it has to do with Trump Media’s financials. The company reported over $4 million in sales last year but also a $60 million loss . That kind of disparity would have sunk a different company. Trump’s personality has contributed to DJT stock’s 81% increase in 2024.
A Closer Look at DJT Stock
For more sober investors who aren’t actively rooting for or against the former president and trading on their emotions, we need to decide whether this social media company is a good investment on its merits.
Creating a social media company with critical mass is no easy feat, and doing it profitably is even more so.
X (formerly Twitter) still struggles to make money after 18 years. Elon Musk has made the platform monetized through ads and user fees. Trump Media might have a more difficult time.
Truth Social, DJT’s social media platform, recorded 1.5 million unique users in March, according to data from SimilarWeb.
That was a 130% surge from February and probably had more to do with people wanting to check out the Trump site as the company began trading publicly. In contrast, X had 115 million monthly users.
Still, Truth Social had far more users than either Parler or Gab. Those sites, however, were the victim of Big Tech conspiring to limit access to their sites .
Parler, for example, saw its platform pulled from Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ).
It had once been the fast-growing app and was cut off at the knees through tech’s concerted efforts.
They’re not likely to take on the former president again, however.
Although Trump was banned from social media after losing the last election, Musk restored his privileges after buying the platform and others followed suit.
Joined at the Hip
DJT stock is going to be volatile, at least throughout the presidential election. If Trump wins the White House again in November, it could extend further. A loss might cut short any nascent growth it might possess.
While investors need to separate the social media platform from the president, the business itself can’t. It highlights the risk of being so closely tied to a larger-than-life personality.
While Steve Jobs at Apple wasn’t quite the same, at least initially the company’s fortunes rose and fell with his presence or absence.
Trump Media & Technology needs time to mature into a vehicle separate from Trump. The social media platform has big plans. Streaming video and becoming a home for alternative media and content creators. It could be big.
Yet a large driving force behind Truth Social was creating a safe space for alternative views that were banned by other social media sites. Now, with Musk a fairly strong free speech advocate, the impetus behind the startup site is now diminished.
Now Is Not the Time
The mainstream media is in decline and in large part has written off large swaths of a potential audience.
In choosing to cater to an ideological base, media has limited its potential. And yet that is what Trump Media is doing too, perhaps of necessity, but definitely a limiting factor.
Amid the wild swings in DJT stock, it’s hard to argue in favor of an investment here. There is just too much volatility unrelated to the actual business of Trump Media & Technology. And that means most investors should just stay on the sidelines.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is in the spotlight today after reporting its quarterly results. Driven by the artificial intelligence ( AI ) frenzy, the company announced its first-ever quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share, payable to shareholders of record as of June 10. In addition to the Google stock dividend, the company also announced that it would spend $70 billion on share buybacks.
More About Alphabet’s Initial Dividend and Share Buybacks
The Google stock dividend will be 80 cents per share annually, which equates to a rather small dividend yield of 0.5%. For comparison, the average S&P 500 dividend yield is about 1.35% . Nonetheless, the tech giant may raise its dividend yield over the longer term.
Ultimately, its yield could rise closer to the 3.3% payout that Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) boasts. GOOG’s payout may ultimately even rival IBM’s (NYSE: IBM ) 3.9% yield. On the other hand, GOOG may emulate Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), which resumed paying a dividend in 2012 after a long hiatus and now has a 0.57% yield.
Those who own GOOG stock as of June 10 will receive the payout on June 17.
Also importantly, the firm disclosed that it intends to buy back another $70 billion of GOOG stock.
Alphabet Delivered Better-Than-Expected Q1 Results
The tech giant generated sales of over $80.5 billion last quarter, well above analysts’ average estimate of $78.5 billion. GOOG’s top line surged 15% versus the same period a year earlier. Its net income soared 57% year-over-year to $23.7 billion, coming in well above analysts’ mean outlook of $19.1 billion.
GOOG’s strong performance was enabled by a “strong performance from Search, YouTube and Cloud,” CEO Sundar Pichai stated. Moreover, the firm’s “leadership in AI research and infrastructure, and our global product footprint, position us well for the next wave of AI innovation,” Pichai reported.

That’s because companies that consistently repurchase their own shares signal strong confidence in their future growth prospects. As a result, stocks with substantial buyback programs often outperform the broader market.
By reducing the number of outstanding shares, buybacks directly increase earnings per share. A higher EPS generally leads to higher valuation multiples and stock prices over time. Companies essentially invest in themselves through buybacks when they believe they have undervalued shares. In turn, this rewards long-term shareholders as the ownership stake and future earnings power grow on a per-share basis.
In 2024, several Silicon Valley technology giants have authorized expansive new buyback programs worth billions. Given their strong free-cash-flow generation and balance-sheet capacity, these innovative companies are in a good position to continue these shareholder-friendly buybacks for years to come.
Apple (AAPL)

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) remains the undisputed leader when it comes to Silicon Valley stocks with buybacks. The company just wrapped up another massive $83.9 billion in buybacks for 2023 , building on the incredible $658 billion spent over the last decade repurchasing shares. In the last quarter of 2023 alone, Apple spent $22.7 billion on buybacks.
This enormous capital return program has delivered tremendous value to shareholders. While Apple’s revenue has grown at a healthy 6.5% CAGR since 2015, EPS growth has averaged around 13% over that stretch thanks largely to buybacks. With the stock consistently trading around 25x earnings, Apple has been able to reduce its outstanding share count by about 3-3.5% annually.
Going forward, Apple’s EPS is expected to continue growing at a high single-digit pace. And with strong free cash flow generation funding future buybacks, investors can expect at least 200 basis points of EPS growth per year over the next 5-10 years to come directly from capital returns. For a mega-cap tech leader producing the immense cash flows that Apple does, buybacks remain a shareholder-friendly avenue to drive growth.
Alphabet (GOOGL)

Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ,NASDAQ: GOOG ), the tech giant behind Google and YouTube, is one of the top Silicon Valley stocks with buybacks. Over the past 10 years, Alphabet has repurchased a massive $240 billion worth of its own shares. In 2023 alone, the company spent $62.2 billion on buybacks , slightly higher than the $59.3 billion spent in 2022.
Importantly, Alphabet’s share repurchase program has no expiration date. The company is authorized to buy back up to another $36.3 billion in shares in 2024 and beyond. With strong free cash flows nearing $70 billion a year , Alphabet has plenty of dry powder to continue repurchases.
Reducing shares outstanding through buybacks boosts Alphabet’s already impressive earnings per share growth. Over the past 5 years, net income has increased approximately 140% while EPS has grown 165% . If Alphabet maintains its buyback pace, EPS could grow over 150% in the next decade. With dominant positions in online search and video, Alphabet has an incredibly profitable underlying business throwing off cash to fund buybacks. The company’s operating margins stand at 25.49% . Alphabet stock is viewed as undervalued today for one of the quality Silicon Valley stocks with buybacks set to drive EPS higher.
Meta Platforms (META)

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) joins Apple and Alphabet as one of the Silicon Valley stocks with buybacks planned for 2024. The company has spent $146 billion on share repurchases over the past decade, signaling strong confidence in its future growth. In 2023 alone, Meta spent $20.03 billion on buybacks.
As of Dec. 31st, 2023, Meta had $30.93 billion authorized for additional repurchases. It also announced a $50 billion increase in its share repurchase program, equal to about 5% of its shares outstanding with its current $1 trillion market capitalization.
Meta’s massive buybacks reward shareholders and reflect its evolution into a finance-focused tech giant resembling Apple. Combined with better-than-expected earnings, Meta’s latest buyback announcement prompted the largest one-day jump in market value for any stock, making Meta a trillion-dollar company again. With efficiency driving improved profitability and over $80 billion now authorized for capital return, Meta’s buybacks will boost EPS growth for years. As one of the true Silicon Valley stocks with buybacks, Meta will likely soar in 2024.

2024-04-26,3 Stocks to Cash In on AI Without Investing in Nvidia,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Artificial intelligence ( AI ) has captured investors’ attention for over one year now. Today, everyone understands its disruptive force and potential to contribute trillions of dollars to the world economy . Although Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) has been an unequalled AI investment, many AI stocks to cash in on exist.
Besides Nvidia, other chip companies are developing AI chips to power the building and training of large language models ( LLM s). Furthermore, due to the demand surge for AI chips, expect growth across the entire semiconductor value chain. Electronic design automation providers, semiconductor equipment suppliers, foundries and testing and packaging providers will all profit.
Then, there are the companies leveraging AI to build tools for customers. They are integrating LLMs to enable faster data processing, personalized customer service and improved productivity.
These three companies have begun monetizing their AI products and are well-positioned to capitalize. They are top stocks to cash in on AI over the next year.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)

Although Nvidia has grabbed most of the AI headlines, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) is a close second. Indeed, the semiconductor company has proved it can match Nvidia’s innovation and expects $3.5 billion in AI chip sales this year.
In December 2023, the company announced its MI300 chips , which have more memory capacity and energy efficiency than prior chips. These chips can power high-performance compute workloads and train the most demanding LLMs. Already, they are seeing robust demand as companies seek to reduce their reliance on Nvidia.
Notably, AMD’s AI chips are emerging as a capable alternative. During the announcement, the company disclosed that it had partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). The software company will use the MI300X on its Azure virtual machines. Another AI leader, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ), also confirmed that it will deploy its MI300 AI chips in its data centers.
Lastly, on April 16, the company launched AI chips to power personal computers . Its Ryzen PRO 8000 series processors for desktops and Ryzen PRO 8040 for laptops are some of the most advanced chips for AI PCs. Indeed, according to Canalys , this could be a huge growth driver. They project that 48 million AI PCs will be sold this year and will grow to 100 million in 2025.
Microsoft (MSFT)
Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com
This technology giant recognized the opportunity in AI early. In January 2023, it announced its partnership with OpenAI and hasn’t looked back since.
First, Azure AI, its cloud infrastructure service, is providing the tools to build, train and deploy LLMs. Most companies don’t want to invest in data centers that provide the compute and storage for AI workloads. That’s where Azure comes in, providing the compute and resources to build and train models, industry-leading LLMs, APIs, storage and tools to build AI solutions.
Secondly, Microsoft continues to heavily invest in integrating AI into its products and services. After all, Microsoft is a productivity company, so it is using AI to simplify tasks and improve decision-making. A good example is GitHub, its developer platform. Over 1.3 million developers now subscribe to GitHub Copilot, which uses AI to complete code and turn natural language prompts into code.
Further, the biggest opportunity is with Microsoft Copilots. In September 2023, the company launched Copilots for Windows and Microsoft 365 applications such as Paint, Notepad, Word, PowerPoint and Excel. Already, Microsoft is charging $30 per user monthly for Copilot. As the service improves with additional capabilities, MSFT will capture more value through price hikes.
Meta Platforms (META)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
Although Meta Platforms might be primarily used for social media, it’s also one of the best stocks to cash in on AI. Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) Mark Zuckerberg is pressing on with AI investments and plans to make the social media giant a key AI player.
The company’s journey into the AI arena was out of necessity. Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) IDFA forced Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, to adopt AI to improve its advertising performance.
Now, these heavy investments in 2021 and 2022 are bearing fruit. The platform has leveraged AI to improve recommendations on its social media platforms and, hence, user engagement. On the customer side, it has improved its platform for advertisers, enabling them to get better performance on their ads.
Also, the company competes in the LLM arena through Llama, its open-source LLM. The plan to keep Llama open source is strategic. Zuckerberg hopes to attract more developers who will improve the platform and make it their default.
So far, the social media giant is keeping pace with competition and recently released Llama 3 . META claims it’s one of the most powerful models available. Considering its continued innovation, Meta Platforms is among the top stocks to cash in on AI.

2024-04-26,3 Tech Stocks That Could Be Heading Six-Feet Under,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Technology stocks had a great run in 2023. This year, not so much. In the past month, the tech-laden Nasdaq composite index has fallen 5%. Mega-cap tech stocks such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) have faltered badly amid escalating concerns that interest rates will remain higher for longer. Possibly much longer. At the same time, notable tech leaders such as Apple appear in rapid decline , having lost their competitive edge and market share.
In time, the market and tech stocks will almost certainly get their mojo back. However, there look to be some technology companies that are facing existential threats that could eventually see them pushed out of business. Threats are taking the form of increased competition, disruptive technologies, and changing consumer tastes. History is littered with once mighty companies that lost their edge and never regained it.
Here are three tech stocks that could be heading six-feet under.
Adobe (ADBE)
Source: Tattoboo / Shutterstock
The stock of Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) hasn’t been the same since privately held OpenAI (the company behind ChatGPT) introduced Sora , an AI platform that can generate videos based on written descriptions. OpenAI’s Sora platform competes directly against many of Adobe’s creative software products and concerns are mounting that AI will ultimately put the company out of business. ADBE stock is down nearly 20% on the year following Sora’s debut and after the company issued weak forward guidance.
Adobe, whose suite of creative software products includes Photoshop and Illustrator , did manage to beat Wall Street forecasts with its latest earnings . However, the company forecast earnings of $4.35 to $4.40 a share and revenue of $5.25 billion to $5.30 billion for the current second quarter. That fell short of expected earnings of $4.38 a share and $5.31 billion in revenue, sending ADBE stock down 12% in a single trading session. Adobe is adding AI where it can, unveiling a new AI assistant for its Reader and Acrobat apps.
In a move that looks like it is waving the white flag, Adobe is reportedly now exploring a partnership with OpenAI and looking to add Sora’s technology to its products. The question is: will it be enough?
Tesla (TSLA)
Source: ssi77 / Shutterstock.com
Are things suddenly better at Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA )? On the day of this writing, TSLA stock is up 12% as investors cheer the company’s plan to rush a more affordable electric vehicle to market. However, the euphoria over a cheaper electric car overlooks the fact that Tesla’s latest earnings print was terrible and showed that things are getting worse at the company. Much worse. For this year’s first quarter, Tesla reported its biggest revenue decline since 2012 as it missed Wall Street’s targets across the board.
Sales were down 9% from a year ago, while Tesla’s net income plunged 55% year-over-year. Tesla also issued a dismal outlook for the remainder of the year, stating that its “volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023.” Tesla continues to struggle with slowing electric vehicle sales and rising competition that has forced it to slash prices at the expense of profit margins. As for the more affordable EV, Tesla is famous for overpromising and underdelivering. Any sign of the “Tesla Bot” yet?
Despite the post-earnings lift, TSLA stock remains down 35% on the year and continues to be one of the worst performing stocks in the benchmark S&P 500 index.
Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD)
Source: Jimmy Tudeschi / Shutterstock.com
Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD ) has been trying to merge with another entertainment company or possibly sell itself as its stock slides lower. At the start of this year, the company was in merger talks with Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA ), although the negotiations were called off in February. Warner Bros. is trying to achieve economies of scale as it struggles to earn profits from streaming while grappling with a decline in advertising revenue at its linear TV stations and dwindling audience attendance at movie theaters.
Warner Bros. Discovery is also labouring under a crushing debt load. While the company paid down $5.4 billion of debt in 2023, it still has $44.20 billion of debt remaining following its 2022 merger with Discovery Inc. Warner Bros. most recent earnings print was bad, with the company reporting a loss of 16 cents a share compared to a loss of 7 cents that was expected among analysts. Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 came in at $10.28 billion, which was below forecasts of $10.35 billion.
The litany of problems has weighed heavily on WBD stock, which is down 66% in the two years since Warner Bros Discovery was formed.

2024-04-26,Trump Media Stock's Wild Ride: Should You Jump on Board or Steer Clear?,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ: DJT ) stock, the Donald Trump media project that recently went public to much fanfare, has the tumultuous nature of meme stock. Shares soared on their first availability, then plunged, but are starting to rise once more.
None of it has to do with Trump Media’s financials. The company reported over $4 million in sales last year but also a $60 million loss . That kind of disparity would have sunk a different company. Trump’s personality has contributed to DJT stock’s 81% increase in 2024.
A Closer Look at DJT Stock
For more sober investors who aren’t actively rooting for or against the former president and trading on their emotions, we need to decide whether this social media company is a good investment on its merits.
Creating a social media company with critical mass is no easy feat, and doing it profitably is even more so.
X (formerly Twitter) still struggles to make money after 18 years. Elon Musk has made the platform monetized through ads and user fees. Trump Media might have a more difficult time.
Truth Social, DJT’s social media platform, recorded 1.5 million unique users in March, according to data from SimilarWeb.
That was a 130% surge from February and probably had more to do with people wanting to check out the Trump site as the company began trading publicly. In contrast, X had 115 million monthly users.
Still, Truth Social had far more users than either Parler or Gab. Those sites, however, were the victim of Big Tech conspiring to limit access to their sites .
Parler, for example, saw its platform pulled from Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ).
It had once been the fast-growing app and was cut off at the knees through tech’s concerted efforts.
They’re not likely to take on the former president again, however.
Although Trump was banned from social media after losing the last election, Musk restored his privileges after buying the platform and others followed suit.
Joined at the Hip
DJT stock is going to be volatile, at least throughout the presidential election. If Trump wins the White House again in November, it could extend further. A loss might cut short any nascent growth it might possess.
While investors need to separate the social media platform from the president, the business itself can’t. It highlights the risk of being so closely tied to a larger-than-life personality.
While Steve Jobs at Apple wasn’t quite the same, at least initially the company’s fortunes rose and fell with his presence or absence.
Trump Media & Technology needs time to mature into a vehicle separate from Trump. The social media platform has big plans. Streaming video and becoming a home for alternative media and content creators. It could be big.
Yet a large driving force behind Truth Social was creating a safe space for alternative views that were banned by other social media sites. Now, with Musk a fairly strong free speech advocate, the impetus behind the startup site is now diminished.
Now Is Not the Time
The mainstream media is in decline and in large part has written off large swaths of a potential audience.
In choosing to cater to an ideological base, media has limited its potential. And yet that is what Trump Media is doing too, perhaps of necessity, but definitely a limiting factor.
Amid the wild swings in DJT stock, it’s hard to argue in favor of an investment here. There is just too much volatility unrelated to the actual business of Trump Media & Technology. And that means most investors should just stay on the sidelines.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is in the spotlight today after reporting its quarterly results. Driven by the artificial intelligence ( AI ) frenzy, the company announced its first-ever quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share, payable to shareholders of record as of June 10. In addition to the Google stock dividend, the company also announced that it would spend $70 billion on share buybacks.
More About Alphabet’s Initial Dividend and Share Buybacks
The Google stock dividend will be 80 cents per share annually, which equates to a rather small dividend yield of 0.5%. For comparison, the average S&P 500 dividend yield is about 1.35% . Nonetheless, the tech giant may raise its dividend yield over the longer term.
Ultimately, its yield could rise closer to the 3.3% payout that Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) boasts. GOOG’s payout may ultimately even rival IBM’s (NYSE: IBM ) 3.9% yield. On the other hand, GOOG may emulate Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), which resumed paying a dividend in 2012 after a long hiatus and now has a 0.57% yield.
Those who own GOOG stock as of June 10 will receive the payout on June 17.
Also importantly, the firm disclosed that it intends to buy back another $70 billion of GOOG stock.
Alphabet Delivered Better-Than-Expected Q1 Results
The tech giant generated sales of over $80.5 billion last quarter, well above analysts’ average estimate of $78.5 billion. GOOG’s top line surged 15% versus the same period a year earlier. Its net income soared 57% year-over-year to $23.7 billion, coming in well above analysts’ mean outlook of $19.1 billion.
GOOG’s strong performance was enabled by a “strong performance from Search, YouTube and Cloud,” CEO Sundar Pichai stated. Moreover, the firm’s “leadership in AI research and infrastructure, and our global product footprint, position us well for the next wave of AI innovation,” Pichai reported.

2024-04-26,3 Silicon Valley Stocks Set to Soar With Massive Buybacks in 2024,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Silicon Valley stocks with buybacks are getting a lot of attention from investors in 2024. That’s because companies that consistently repurchase their own shares signal strong confidence in their future growth prospects. As a result, stocks with substantial buyback programs often outperform the broader market.
By reducing the number of outstanding shares, buybacks directly increase earnings per share. A higher EPS generally leads to higher valuation multiples and stock prices over time. Companies essentially invest in themselves through buybacks when they believe they have undervalued shares. In turn, this rewards long-term shareholders as the ownership stake and future earnings power grow on a per-share basis.
In 2024, several Silicon Valley technology giants have authorized expansive new buyback programs worth billions. Given their strong free-cash-flow generation and balance-sheet capacity, these innovative companies are in a good position to continue these shareholder-friendly buybacks for years to come.
Apple (AAPL)

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) remains the undisputed leader when it comes to Silicon Valley stocks with buybacks. The company just wrapped up another massive $83.9 billion in buybacks for 2023 , building on the incredible $658 billion spent over the last decade repurchasing shares. In the last quarter of 2023 alone, Apple spent $22.7 billion on buybacks.
This enormous capital return program has delivered tremendous value to shareholders. While Apple’s revenue has grown at a healthy 6.5% CAGR since 2015, EPS growth has averaged around 13% over that stretch thanks largely to buybacks. With the stock consistently trading around 25x earnings, Apple has been able to reduce its outstanding share count by about 3-3.5% annually.
Going forward, Apple’s EPS is expected to continue growing at a high single-digit pace. And with strong free cash flow generation funding future buybacks, investors can expect at least 200 basis points of EPS growth per year over the next 5-10 years to come directly from capital returns. For a mega-cap tech leader producing the immense cash flows that Apple does, buybacks remain a shareholder-friendly avenue to drive growth.
Alphabet (GOOGL)

Importantly, Alphabet’s share repurchase program has no expiration date. The company is authorized to buy back up to another $36.3 billion in shares in 2024 and beyond. With strong free cash flows nearing $70 billion a year , Alphabet has plenty of dry powder to continue repurchases.
Reducing shares outstanding through buybacks boosts Alphabet’s already impressive earnings per share growth. Over the past 5 years, net income has increased approximately 140% while EPS has grown 165% . If Alphabet maintains its buyback pace, EPS could grow over 150% in the next decade. With dominant positions in online search and video, Alphabet has an incredibly profitable underlying business throwing off cash to fund buybacks. The company’s operating margins stand at 25.49% . Alphabet stock is viewed as undervalued today for one of the quality Silicon Valley stocks with buybacks set to drive EPS higher.

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) joins Apple and Alphabet as one of the Silicon Valley stocks with buybacks planned for 2024. The company has spent $146 billion on share repurchases over the past decade, signaling strong confidence in its future growth. In 2023 alone, Meta spent $20.03 billion on buybacks.
As of Dec. 31st, 2023, Meta had $30.93 billion authorized for additional repurchases. It also announced a $50 billion increase in its share repurchase program, equal to about 5% of its shares outstanding with its current $1 trillion market capitalization.
Meta’s massive buybacks reward shareholders and reflect its evolution into a finance-focused tech giant resembling Apple. Combined with better-than-expected earnings, Meta’s latest buyback announcement prompted the largest one-day jump in market value for any stock, making Meta a trillion-dollar company again. With efficiency driving improved profitability and over $80 billion now authorized for capital return, Meta’s buybacks will boost EPS growth for years. As one of the true Silicon Valley stocks with buybacks, Meta will likely soar in 2024.

2024-04-26,3 Stocks to Cash In on AI Without Investing in Nvidia,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Artificial intelligence ( AI ) has captured investors’ attention for over one year now. Today, everyone understands its disruptive force and potential to contribute trillions of dollars to the world economy . Although Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) has been an unequalled AI investment, many AI stocks to cash in on exist.
Besides Nvidia, other chip companies are developing AI chips to power the building and training of large language models ( LLM s). Furthermore, due to the demand surge for AI chips, expect growth across the entire semiconductor value chain. Electronic design automation providers, semiconductor equipment suppliers, foundries and testing and packaging providers will all profit.
Then, there are the companies leveraging AI to build tools for customers. They are integrating LLMs to enable faster data processing, personalized customer service and improved productivity.
These three companies have begun monetizing their AI products and are well-positioned to capitalize. They are top stocks to cash in on AI over the next year.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)

Although Nvidia has grabbed most of the AI headlines, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) is a close second. Indeed, the semiconductor company has proved it can match Nvidia’s innovation and expects $3.5 billion in AI chip sales this year.
In December 2023, the company announced its MI300 chips , which have more memory capacity and energy efficiency than prior chips. These chips can power high-performance compute workloads and train the most demanding LLMs. Already, they are seeing robust demand as companies seek to reduce their reliance on Nvidia.
Notably, AMD’s AI chips are emerging as a capable alternative. During the announcement, the company disclosed that it had partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). The software company will use the MI300X on its Azure virtual machines. Another AI leader, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ), also confirmed that it will deploy its MI300 AI chips in its data centers.
Lastly, on April 16, the company launched AI chips to power personal computers . Its Ryzen PRO 8000 series processors for desktops and Ryzen PRO 8040 for laptops are some of the most advanced chips for AI PCs. Indeed, according to Canalys , this could be a huge growth driver. They project that 48 million AI PCs will be sold this year and will grow to 100 million in 2025.
Microsoft (MSFT)

This technology giant recognized the opportunity in AI early. In January 2023, it announced its partnership with OpenAI and hasn’t looked back since.
First, Azure AI, its cloud infrastructure service, is providing the tools to build, train and deploy LLMs. Most companies don’t want to invest in data centers that provide the compute and storage for AI workloads. That’s where Azure comes in, providing the compute and resources to build and train models, industry-leading LLMs, APIs, storage and tools to build AI solutions.
Secondly, Microsoft continues to heavily invest in integrating AI into its products and services. After all, Microsoft is a productivity company, so it is using AI to simplify tasks and improve decision-making. A good example is GitHub, its developer platform. Over 1.3 million developers now subscribe to GitHub Copilot, which uses AI to complete code and turn natural language prompts into code.
Further, the biggest opportunity is with Microsoft Copilots. In September 2023, the company launched Copilots for Windows and Microsoft 365 applications such as Paint, Notepad, Word, PowerPoint and Excel. Already, Microsoft is charging $30 per user monthly for Copilot. As the service improves with additional capabilities, MSFT will capture more value through price hikes.
Meta Platforms (META)

Although Meta Platforms might be primarily used for social media, it’s also one of the best stocks to cash in on AI. Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) Mark Zuckerberg is pressing on with AI investments and plans to make the social media giant a key AI player.
The company’s journey into the AI arena was out of necessity. Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) IDFA forced Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, to adopt AI to improve its advertising performance.
Now, these heavy investments in 2021 and 2022 are bearing fruit. The platform has leveraged AI to improve recommendations on its social media platforms and, hence, user engagement. On the customer side, it has improved its platform for advertisers, enabling them to get better performance on their ads.
Also, the company competes in the LLM arena through Llama, its open-source LLM. The plan to keep Llama open source is strategic. Zuckerberg hopes to attract more developers who will improve the platform and make it their default.
So far, the social media giant is keeping pace with competition and recently released Llama 3 . META claims it’s one of the most powerful models available. Considering its continued innovation, Meta Platforms is among the top stocks to cash in on AI.

2024-04-26,3 Tech Stocks That Could Be Heading Six-Feet Under,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Technology stocks had a great run in 2023. This year, not so much. In the past month, the tech-laden Nasdaq composite index has fallen 5%. Mega-cap tech stocks such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) have faltered badly amid escalating concerns that interest rates will remain higher for longer. Possibly much longer. At the same time, notable tech leaders such as Apple appear in rapid decline , having lost their competitive edge and market share.
In time, the market and tech stocks will almost certainly get their mojo back. However, there look to be some technology companies that are facing existential threats that could eventually see them pushed out of business. Threats are taking the form of increased competition, disruptive technologies, and changing consumer tastes. History is littered with once mighty companies that lost their edge and never regained it.
Here are three tech stocks that could be heading six-feet under.
Adobe (ADBE)
Source: Tattoboo / Shutterstock
The stock of Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) hasn’t been the same since privately held OpenAI (the company behind ChatGPT) introduced Sora , an AI platform that can generate videos based on written descriptions. OpenAI’s Sora platform competes directly against many of Adobe’s creative software products and concerns are mounting that AI will ultimately put the company out of business. ADBE stock is down nearly 20% on the year following Sora’s debut and after the company issued weak forward guidance.
Adobe, whose suite of creative software products includes Photoshop and Illustrator , did manage to beat Wall Street forecasts with its latest earnings . However, the company forecast earnings of $4.35 to $4.40 a share and revenue of $5.25 billion to $5.30 billion for the current second quarter. That fell short of expected earnings of $4.38 a share and $5.31 billion in revenue, sending ADBE stock down 12% in a single trading session. Adobe is adding AI where it can, unveiling a new AI assistant for its Reader and Acrobat apps.
In a move that looks like it is waving the white flag, Adobe is reportedly now exploring a partnership with OpenAI and looking to add Sora’s technology to its products. The question is: will it be enough?
Tesla (TSLA)
Source: ssi77 / Shutterstock.com
Are things suddenly better at Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA )? On the day of this writing, TSLA stock is up 12% as investors cheer the company’s plan to rush a more affordable electric vehicle to market. However, the euphoria over a cheaper electric car overlooks the fact that Tesla’s latest earnings print was terrible and showed that things are getting worse at the company. Much worse. For this year’s first quarter, Tesla reported its biggest revenue decline since 2012 as it missed Wall Street’s targets across the board.
Sales were down 9% from a year ago, while Tesla’s net income plunged 55% year-over-year. Tesla also issued a dismal outlook for the remainder of the year, stating that its “volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023.” Tesla continues to struggle with slowing electric vehicle sales and rising competition that has forced it to slash prices at the expense of profit margins. As for the more affordable EV, Tesla is famous for overpromising and underdelivering. Any sign of the “Tesla Bot” yet?
Despite the post-earnings lift, TSLA stock remains down 35% on the year and continues to be one of the worst performing stocks in the benchmark S&P 500 index.
Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD)
Source: Jimmy Tudeschi / Shutterstock.com
Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD ) has been trying to merge with another entertainment company or possibly sell itself as its stock slides lower. At the start of this year, the company was in merger talks with Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA ), although the negotiations were called off in February. Warner Bros. is trying to achieve economies of scale as it struggles to earn profits from streaming while grappling with a decline in advertising revenue at its linear TV stations and dwindling audience attendance at movie theaters.
Warner Bros. Discovery is also labouring under a crushing debt load. While the company paid down $5.4 billion of debt in 2023, it still has $44.20 billion of debt remaining following its 2022 merger with Discovery Inc. Warner Bros. most recent earnings print was bad, with the company reporting a loss of 16 cents a share compared to a loss of 7 cents that was expected among analysts. Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 came in at $10.28 billion, which was below forecasts of $10.35 billion.
The litany of problems has weighed heavily on WBD stock, which is down 66% in the two years since Warner Bros Discovery was formed.

Julian Lin: Yes. So, Reddit stock, it's quite interesting. It just IPO -ed about one-month ago. A lot of investors might view it as a meme stock, especially because the origin of meme stocks has probably come from that WallStreetBets subreddit, a community on Reddit.

Market Review
The first quarter of 2024 saw a decoupling of the relationship between bond yields and equities, with the S&P 500 rising 10.6%, the Russell 1000 Growth rising 11.4%, and the Dow rising 5.6%. These equity gains materialized despite the 10-year treasury yield increasing from 3.86% on January 1st to 4.20% on March 31st. The S&P's 10.6% return followed on the heels of the 11.7% return in 4Q23, marking just the third time in the past 12 years that the index has had two consecutive quarters of double-digit gains. Even more astonishing than the returns has been the lack of downside volatility, with only two weekly drops for the S&P so far year-to-date, no weekly drops of greater than 2% since October 23rd, and 22 new all-time highs for the index thus far in 2024. Looking at the broader investable-asset universe, the 1st quarter saw a rally in global equities, commodities, gold, the Japanese stock market, crypto markets, and meme stocks. This broad asset-price appreciation took shape in the face of heavily fluctuating Federal Funds rate expectations. To start the year, market participants had priced in six rate cuts (totaling 150bps of cumulative reduction) and a soft-landing (or no-landing) scenario for the US economy. Fast-forward three months, and we have now witnessed three consecutive months of accelerating headline CPI (3.1% in January, 3.2% in February, and 3.5% in March) and the market's latest forecast for only 1-2 rate cuts, representing cumulative cuts of 25-50bps....",23
2024-04-25,Meta Platforms Stock Is Down 10%. Is This the Beginning of the End?,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) reported solid first-quarter results, but META stock is sinking about 10% this morning due to Wall Street’s disappointment with Meta’s revenue guidance. Investors are also worried about CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s comments regarding the tech giant’s high expenditures.
Meanwhile, Meta Platforms’ guidance miss is having a negative impact on other tech names, including the other components of the Magnificent Seven. Meta’s disappointing performance may indeed make the Street less bullish on the Mag 7 as a whole.
Solid Q1 Results, Disappointing Guidance and Cautious Comments
Meta Platforms reported Q1 revenue of $36.4 billion versus analysts’ average estimate of $36.22 billion. EPS also came in at $4.71, well above the estimate for $4.32 per share.
However, the firm provided Q2 sales guidance of between $36.5 billion and $39 billion. The middle of that range comes in below analysts’ average outlook of $38.3 billion.
Meanwhile, the company raised its 2024 capital expenditure guidance to between $35 billion and $40 billion, up from its previous outlook of between $30 billion and $37 billion. Meta Platforms attributed the increase to its increased investments in artificial intelligence ( AI ).
Noting that Meta Platforms is “scaling a new product but [not] yet monetizing it,” Zuckerberg said that META stock has undergone a great deal of “volatility” during such periods of investment in the past. However, the CEO added that the firm will have multiple opportunities down the road to use AI to greatly improve its financial results.
The Mag 7’s Outlook
Meta Platforms’ guidance miss and spending hike could meaningfully dent investors’ belief in the impregnability of the Magnificent Seven. At the very least, three members of the group — Meta Platforms, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TESLA ) — are now largely out of favor with major investors.
But the problems with those stocks could boost other members of the Mag 7 and lift firms outside of the tech sector that have been rapidly growing, such as General Motors (NYSE: GM ) and Chipotle (NYSE: CMG ). Some tremendously beaten-down mid-cap and small-cap stocks could benefit from Mag 7 weakness as well.

2024-04-25,3 Tech Stocks to Sell Now Before the Next Market Downturn Hits,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
After leading the market higher coming out of the 2022 bear market, technology stocks have hit a rough patch. Sentiment towards the mega-cap tech companies has also shifted, as it now looks like interest rates will remain higher for longer.
At the same time, geopolitical instability and spiking bond yields have zapped investors’ risk appetite. Throw in hit-and-miss earnings reports and shifting consumer habits, and you have the makings of a downturn.
In the last month, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index has fallen 5%, with much of that decline coming since April 11. Some tech stocks have been hit worse than others, as signs emerge that their business may be slowing or the outlook for the remainder of the year has changed.
Wall Street appears to be bracing for more downside ahead, with some analysts calling for a full-blown 10% market correction . In this rapidly evolving environment, investors should reposition their portfolio and batten down the hatches.
Here are three tech stocks to sell now before the next market downturn hits.
Cadence Design Systems (CDNS)
Source: mrinalpal / Shutterstock.com
The stock of Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ: CDNS ) fell after the maker of semiconductor-design software issued forward guidance that fell short of Wall Street forecasts. Disappointing guidance is starting to become a theme at Cadence Design, which did the same thing in January of this year, sending its share price lower. CDNS stock is now up about 6% on the year, lagging the performance of many other semiconductor stocks .
The weak guidance is particularly frustrating, given that Cadence Design Systems consistently beats Wall Street expectations in its quarterly earnings. The company reported first quarter 2024 earnings per share of $1.17, which was better than the $1.13 expected among analysts. Revenue in Q1 totaled $1 billion, which was inline with forecasts. Cadence Design also said that it ended Q1 with a record backlog of $6 billion in orders.
Despite the earnings beat and record orders, management once again provided guidance below analysts’ expectations . The company now projects revenue of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion for the current second quarter, with earnings of $1.20 to $1.24 per share. Analysts had been looking for Q2 revenue of $1.10 billion and $1.43 a share in earnings. The weak outlook makes Cadence Design Systems a tech stock to sell.
Netflix (NFLX)
Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com
Don’t mess with the subscriber numbers. That was the takeaway from the Q1 print of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ). The streaming giant’s stock fell 10% after management announced that they will no longer report quarterly membership numbers and average revenue per membership.
Moreover, the leadership team said they are stopping the reporting of subscriber numbers , as they want investors to focus instead on metrics such as revenue, operating margins and free cash flow. That news did not go over well with investors.
More than a few analysts said the move is a red flag and a sign that subscriber growth is slowing at the world’s largest movie and TV streaming platform. Subscriber numbers have always been a way for analysts and investors to compare Netflix and its growth to competing streaming services, such as those offered by Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS ).
News that the reporting of subscribers will be ending at Netflix completely overshadowed what was otherwise a strong Q1 print from the company.
While NFLX stock is still up about 26% on the year, any signs of slowing subscriber growth are likely to be problematic for the company and its share price moving forward. As such, Netflix looks like a tech stock to sell before the next market downturn hits.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com
Of course, there are still reasons to like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), and the long-term outlook for the stock remains largely positive. But in the near-term, things are getting messy.
Each piece of news related to the consumer electronics company seems to be worse than the last. Case in point: Apple’s iPhone sales in China fell 19% during this year’s first quarter, according to data from Counterpoint Research. Another recent report claimed that Q1 iPhone sales in China declined 9.6%.
At the same time, media reports note that Apple’s senior executives have been selling millions of dollars worth of company stock ahead of the upcoming May 2 Q1 earnings.
Apple CEO Tim Cook has sold $33.3 million of Apple stock in April. While Apple has said that the stock sales were prearranged, seeing the executive team dump AAPL stock right before earnings as iPhone sales plunge is a bad look. It also puts more of a spotlight on Apple’s upcoming print, which is shaping up to be a make or break moment for the stock.

2024-04-26,Trump Media Stock's Wild Ride: Should You Jump on Board or Steer Clear?,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ: DJT ) stock, the Donald Trump media project that recently went public to much fanfare, has the tumultuous nature of meme stock. Shares soared on their first availability, then plunged, but are starting to rise once more.
None of it has to do with Trump Media’s financials. The company reported over $4 million in sales last year but also a $60 million loss . That kind of disparity would have sunk a different company. Trump’s personality has contributed to DJT stock’s 81% increase in 2024.
A Closer Look at DJT Stock
For more sober investors who aren’t actively rooting for or against the former president and trading on their emotions, we need to decide whether this social media company is a good investment on its merits.
Creating a social media company with critical mass is no easy feat, and doing it profitably is even more so.
X (formerly Twitter) still struggles to make money after 18 years. Elon Musk has made the platform monetized through ads and user fees. Trump Media might have a more difficult time.
Truth Social, DJT’s social media platform, recorded 1.5 million unique users in March, according to data from SimilarWeb.
That was a 130% surge from February and probably had more to do with people wanting to check out the Trump site as the company began trading publicly. In contrast, X had 115 million monthly users.
Still, Truth Social had far more users than either Parler or Gab. Those sites, however, were the victim of Big Tech conspiring to limit access to their sites .
Parler, for example, saw its platform pulled from Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ).
It had once been the fast-growing app and was cut off at the knees through tech’s concerted efforts.
They’re not likely to take on the former president again, however.
Although Trump was banned from social media after losing the last election, Musk restored his privileges after buying the platform and others followed suit.
Joined at the Hip
DJT stock is going to be volatile, at least throughout the presidential election. If Trump wins the White House again in November, it could extend further. A loss might cut short any nascent growth it might possess.
While investors need to separate the social media platform from the president, the business itself can’t. It highlights the risk of being so closely tied to a larger-than-life personality.
While Steve Jobs at Apple wasn’t quite the same, at least initially the company’s fortunes rose and fell with his presence or absence.
Trump Media & Technology needs time to mature into a vehicle separate from Trump. The social media platform has big plans. Streaming video and becoming a home for alternative media and content creators. It could be big.
Yet a large driving force behind Truth Social was creating a safe space for alternative views that were banned by other social media sites. Now, with Musk a fairly strong free speech advocate, the impetus behind the startup site is now diminished.
Now Is Not the Time
The mainstream media is in decline and in large part has written off large swaths of a potential audience.
In choosing to cater to an ideological base, media has limited its potential. And yet that is what Trump Media is doing too, perhaps of necessity, but definitely a limiting factor.
Amid the wild swings in DJT stock, it’s hard to argue in favor of an investment here. There is just too much volatility unrelated to the actual business of Trump Media & Technology. And that means most investors should just stay on the sidelines.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is in the spotlight today after reporting its quarterly results. Driven by the artificial intelligence ( AI ) frenzy, the company announced its first-ever quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share, payable to shareholders of record as of June 10. In addition to the Google stock dividend, the company also announced that it would spend $70 billion on share buybacks.
More About Alphabet’s Initial Dividend and Share Buybacks
The Google stock dividend will be 80 cents per share annually, which equates to a rather small dividend yield of 0.5%. For comparison, the average S&P 500 dividend yield is about 1.35% . Nonetheless, the tech giant may raise its dividend yield over the longer term.
Ultimately, its yield could rise closer to the 3.3% payout that Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) boasts. GOOG’s payout may ultimately even rival IBM’s (NYSE: IBM ) 3.9% yield. On the other hand, GOOG may emulate Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), which resumed paying a dividend in 2012 after a long hiatus and now has a 0.57% yield.
Those who own GOOG stock as of June 10 will receive the payout on June 17.
Also importantly, the firm disclosed that it intends to buy back another $70 billion of GOOG stock.
Alphabet Delivered Better-Than-Expected Q1 Results
The tech giant generated sales of over $80.5 billion last quarter, well above analysts’ average estimate of $78.5 billion. GOOG’s top line surged 15% versus the same period a year earlier. Its net income soared 57% year-over-year to $23.7 billion, coming in well above analysts’ mean outlook of $19.1 billion.
GOOG’s strong performance was enabled by a “strong performance from Search, YouTube and Cloud,” CEO Sundar Pichai stated. Moreover, the firm’s “leadership in AI research and infrastructure, and our global product footprint, position us well for the next wave of AI innovation,” Pichai reported.

2024-04-26,3 Silicon Valley Stocks Set to Soar With Massive Buybacks in 2024,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Silicon Valley stocks with buybacks are getting a lot of attention from investors in 2024. That’s because companies that consistently repurchase their own shares signal strong confidence in their future growth prospects. As a result, stocks with substantial buyback programs often outperform the broader market.
By reducing the number of outstanding shares, buybacks directly increase earnings per share. A higher EPS generally leads to higher valuation multiples and stock prices over time. Companies essentially invest in themselves through buybacks when they believe they have undervalued shares. In turn, this rewards long-term shareholders as the ownership stake and future earnings power grow on a per-share basis.
In 2024, several Silicon Valley technology giants have authorized expansive new buyback programs worth billions. Given their strong free-cash-flow generation and balance-sheet capacity, these innovative companies are in a good position to continue these shareholder-friendly buybacks for years to come.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) remains the undisputed leader when it comes to Silicon Valley stocks with buybacks. The company just wrapped up another massive $83.9 billion in buybacks for 2023 , building on the incredible $658 billion spent over the last decade repurchasing shares. In the last quarter of 2023 alone, Apple spent $22.7 billion on buybacks.
This enormous capital return program has delivered tremendous value to shareholders. While Apple’s revenue has grown at a healthy 6.5% CAGR since 2015, EPS growth has averaged around 13% over that stretch thanks largely to buybacks. With the stock consistently trading around 25x earnings, Apple has been able to reduce its outstanding share count by about 3-3.5% annually.
Going forward, Apple’s EPS is expected to continue growing at a high single-digit pace. And with strong free cash flow generation funding future buybacks, investors can expect at least 200 basis points of EPS growth per year over the next 5-10 years to come directly from capital returns. For a mega-cap tech leader producing the immense cash flows that Apple does, buybacks remain a shareholder-friendly avenue to drive growth.
Alphabet (GOOGL)
Source: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com
Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ,NASDAQ: GOOG ), the tech giant behind Google and YouTube, is one of the top Silicon Valley stocks with buybacks. Over the past 10 years, Alphabet has repurchased a massive $240 billion worth of its own shares. In 2023 alone, the company spent $62.2 billion on buybacks , slightly higher than the $59.3 billion spent in 2022.
Importantly, Alphabet’s share repurchase program has no expiration date. The company is authorized to buy back up to another $36.3 billion in shares in 2024 and beyond. With strong free cash flows nearing $70 billion a year , Alphabet has plenty of dry powder to continue repurchases.
Reducing shares outstanding through buybacks boosts Alphabet’s already impressive earnings per share growth. Over the past 5 years, net income has increased approximately 140% while EPS has grown 165% . If Alphabet maintains its buyback pace, EPS could grow over 150% in the next decade. With dominant positions in online search and video, Alphabet has an incredibly profitable underlying business throwing off cash to fund buybacks. The company’s operating margins stand at 25.49% . Alphabet stock is viewed as undervalued today for one of the quality Silicon Valley stocks with buybacks set to drive EPS higher.
Meta Platforms (META)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) joins Apple and Alphabet as one of the Silicon Valley stocks with buybacks planned for 2024. The company has spent $146 billion on share repurchases over the past decade, signaling strong confidence in its future growth. In 2023 alone, Meta spent $20.03 billion on buybacks.
As of Dec. 31st, 2023, Meta had $30.93 billion authorized for additional repurchases. It also announced a $50 billion increase in its share repurchase program, equal to about 5% of its shares outstanding with its current $1 trillion market capitalization.
Meta’s massive buybacks reward shareholders and reflect its evolution into a finance-focused tech giant resembling Apple. Combined with better-than-expected earnings, Meta’s latest buyback announcement prompted the largest one-day jump in market value for any stock, making Meta a trillion-dollar company again. With efficiency driving improved profitability and over $80 billion now authorized for capital return, Meta’s buybacks will boost EPS growth for years. As one of the true Silicon Valley stocks with buybacks, Meta will likely soar in 2024.

2024-04-26,3 Stocks to Cash In on AI Without Investing in Nvidia,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Artificial intelligence ( AI ) has captured investors’ attention for over one year now. Today, everyone understands its disruptive force and potential to contribute trillions of dollars to the world economy . Although Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) has been an unequalled AI investment, many AI stocks to cash in on exist.
Besides Nvidia, other chip companies are developing AI chips to power the building and training of large language models ( LLM s). Furthermore, due to the demand surge for AI chips, expect growth across the entire semiconductor value chain. Electronic design automation providers, semiconductor equipment suppliers, foundries and testing and packaging providers will all profit.
Then, there are the companies leveraging AI to build tools for customers. They are integrating LLMs to enable faster data processing, personalized customer service and improved productivity.
These three companies have begun monetizing their AI products and are well-positioned to capitalize. They are top stocks to cash in on AI over the next year.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
Although Nvidia has grabbed most of the AI headlines, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) is a close second. Indeed, the semiconductor company has proved it can match Nvidia’s innovation and expects $3.5 billion in AI chip sales this year.
In December 2023, the company announced its MI300 chips , which have more memory capacity and energy efficiency than prior chips. These chips can power high-performance compute workloads and train the most demanding LLMs. Already, they are seeing robust demand as companies seek to reduce their reliance on Nvidia.
Notably, AMD’s AI chips are emerging as a capable alternative. During the announcement, the company disclosed that it had partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). The software company will use the MI300X on its Azure virtual machines. Another AI leader, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ), also confirmed that it will deploy its MI300 AI chips in its data centers.
Lastly, on April 16, the company launched AI chips to power personal computers . Its Ryzen PRO 8000 series processors for desktops and Ryzen PRO 8040 for laptops are some of the most advanced chips for AI PCs. Indeed, according to Canalys , this could be a huge growth driver. They project that 48 million AI PCs will be sold this year and will grow to 100 million in 2025.
Microsoft (MSFT)
Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com
This technology giant recognized the opportunity in AI early. In January 2023, it announced its partnership with OpenAI and hasn’t looked back since.
First, Azure AI, its cloud infrastructure service, is providing the tools to build, train and deploy LLMs. Most companies don’t want to invest in data centers that provide the compute and storage for AI workloads. That’s where Azure comes in, providing the compute and resources to build and train models, industry-leading LLMs, APIs, storage and tools to build AI solutions.
Secondly, Microsoft continues to heavily invest in integrating AI into its products and services. After all, Microsoft is a productivity company, so it is using AI to simplify tasks and improve decision-making. A good example is GitHub, its developer platform. Over 1.3 million developers now subscribe to GitHub Copilot, which uses AI to complete code and turn natural language prompts into code.
Further, the biggest opportunity is with Microsoft Copilots. In September 2023, the company launched Copilots for Windows and Microsoft 365 applications such as Paint, Notepad, Word, PowerPoint and Excel. Already, Microsoft is charging $30 per user monthly for Copilot. As the service improves with additional capabilities, MSFT will capture more value through price hikes.
Meta Platforms (META)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
Although Meta Platforms might be primarily used for social media, it’s also one of the best stocks to cash in on AI. Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) Mark Zuckerberg is pressing on with AI investments and plans to make the social media giant a key AI player.
The company’s journey into the AI arena was out of necessity. Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) IDFA forced Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, to adopt AI to improve its advertising performance.
Now, these heavy investments in 2021 and 2022 are bearing fruit. The platform has leveraged AI to improve recommendations on its social media platforms and, hence, user engagement. On the customer side, it has improved its platform for advertisers, enabling them to get better performance on their ads.
Also, the company competes in the LLM arena through Llama, its open-source LLM. The plan to keep Llama open source is strategic. Zuckerberg hopes to attract more developers who will improve the platform and make it their default.
So far, the social media giant is keeping pace with competition and recently released Llama 3 . META claims it’s one of the most powerful models available. Considering its continued innovation, Meta Platforms is among the top stocks to cash in on AI.

2024-04-26,3 Tech Stocks That Could Be Heading Six-Feet Under,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Technology stocks had a great run in 2023. This year, not so much. In the past month, the tech-laden Nasdaq composite index has fallen 5%. Mega-cap tech stocks such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) have faltered badly amid escalating concerns that interest rates will remain higher for longer. Possibly much longer. At the same time, notable tech leaders such as Apple appear in rapid decline , having lost their competitive edge and market share.
In time, the market and tech stocks will almost certainly get their mojo back. However, there look to be some technology companies that are facing existential threats that could eventually see them pushed out of business. Threats are taking the form of increased competition, disruptive technologies, and changing consumer tastes. History is littered with once mighty companies that lost their edge and never regained it.
Here are three tech stocks that could be heading six-feet under.
Adobe (ADBE)
Source: Tattoboo / Shutterstock
The stock of Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) hasn’t been the same since privately held OpenAI (the company behind ChatGPT) introduced Sora , an AI platform that can generate videos based on written descriptions. OpenAI’s Sora platform competes directly against many of Adobe’s creative software products and concerns are mounting that AI will ultimately put the company out of business. ADBE stock is down nearly 20% on the year following Sora’s debut and after the company issued weak forward guidance.
Adobe, whose suite of creative software products includes Photoshop and Illustrator , did manage to beat Wall Street forecasts with its latest earnings . However, the company forecast earnings of $4.35 to $4.40 a share and revenue of $5.25 billion to $5.30 billion for the current second quarter. That fell short of expected earnings of $4.38 a share and $5.31 billion in revenue, sending ADBE stock down 12% in a single trading session. Adobe is adding AI where it can, unveiling a new AI assistant for its Reader and Acrobat apps.
In a move that looks like it is waving the white flag, Adobe is reportedly now exploring a partnership with OpenAI and looking to add Sora’s technology to its products. The question is: will it be enough?
Tesla (TSLA)
Source: ssi77 / Shutterstock.com
Are things suddenly better at Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA )? On the day of this writing, TSLA stock is up 12% as investors cheer the company’s plan to rush a more affordable electric vehicle to market. However, the euphoria over a cheaper electric car overlooks the fact that Tesla’s latest earnings print was terrible and showed that things are getting worse at the company. Much worse. For this year’s first quarter, Tesla reported its biggest revenue decline since 2012 as it missed Wall Street’s targets across the board.
Sales were down 9% from a year ago, while Tesla’s net income plunged 55% year-over-year. Tesla also issued a dismal outlook for the remainder of the year, stating that its “volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023.” Tesla continues to struggle with slowing electric vehicle sales and rising competition that has forced it to slash prices at the expense of profit margins. As for the more affordable EV, Tesla is famous for overpromising and underdelivering. Any sign of the “Tesla Bot” yet?
Despite the post-earnings lift, TSLA stock remains down 35% on the year and continues to be one of the worst performing stocks in the benchmark S&P 500 index.
Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD)
Source: Jimmy Tudeschi / Shutterstock.com
Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD ) has been trying to merge with another entertainment company or possibly sell itself as its stock slides lower. At the start of this year, the company was in merger talks with Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA ), although the negotiations were called off in February. Warner Bros. is trying to achieve economies of scale as it struggles to earn profits from streaming while grappling with a decline in advertising revenue at its linear TV stations and dwindling audience attendance at movie theaters.
Warner Bros. Discovery is also labouring under a crushing debt load. While the company paid down $5.4 billion of debt in 2023, it still has $44.20 billion of debt remaining following its 2022 merger with Discovery Inc. Warner Bros. most recent earnings print was bad, with the company reporting a loss of 16 cents a share compared to a loss of 7 cents that was expected among analysts. Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 came in at $10.28 billion, which was below forecasts of $10.35 billion.
The litany of problems has weighed heavily on WBD stock, which is down 66% in the two years since Warner Bros Discovery was formed.

Rena Sherbill: Julian Lin, great to have you back on Investing Experts. Always great to talk to you.
So, talk to us about a recent IPO that the market has reacted to a bit. What do you have to say about the company Reddit ( RDDT )?
Julian Lin: Yes. So, Reddit stock, it's quite interesting. It just IPO -ed about one-month ago. A lot of investors might view it as a meme stock, especially because the origin of meme stocks has probably come from that WallStreetBets subreddit, a community on Reddit.
And then also Reddit stock is IPO-ing right now amidst some very rich tech valuations . So, there's a lot of reasons to view it as a meme stock, but I view it as one of my top conviction ideas right now. So, I'm actually very bullish on the stock and the current valuation in spite of a lot of that negative sentiment....",24

Market Review
The first quarter of 2024 saw a decoupling of the relationship between bond yields and equities, with the S&P 500 rising 10.6%, the Russell 1000 Growth rising 11.4%, and the Dow rising 5.6%. These equity gains materialized despite the 10-year treasury yield increasing from 3.86% on January 1st to 4.20% on March 31st. The S&P's 10.6% return followed on the heels of the 11.7% return in 4Q23, marking just the third time in the past 12 years that the index has had two consecutive quarters of double-digit gains. Even more astonishing than the returns has been the lack of downside volatility, with only two weekly drops for the S&P so far year-to-date, no weekly drops of greater than 2% since October 23rd, and 22 new all-time highs for the index thus far in 2024. Looking at the broader investable-asset universe, the 1st quarter saw a rally in global equities, commodities, gold, the Japanese stock market, crypto markets, and meme stocks. This broad asset-price appreciation took shape in the face of heavily fluctuating Federal Funds rate expectations. To start the year, market participants had priced in six rate cuts (totaling 150bps of cumulative reduction) and a soft-landing (or no-landing) scenario for the US economy. Fast-forward three months, and we have now witnessed three consecutive months of accelerating headline CPI (3.1% in January, 3.2% in February, and 3.5% in March) and the market's latest forecast for only 1-2 rate cuts, representing cumulative cuts of 25-50bps....",24
2024-04-25,Meta Platforms Stock Is Down 10%. Is This the Beginning of the End?,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) reported solid first-quarter results, but META stock is sinking about 10% this morning due to Wall Street’s disappointment with Meta’s revenue guidance. Investors are also worried about CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s comments regarding the tech giant’s high expenditures.
Meanwhile, Meta Platforms’ guidance miss is having a negative impact on other tech names, including the other components of the Magnificent Seven. Meta’s disappointing performance may indeed make the Street less bullish on the Mag 7 as a whole.
Solid Q1 Results, Disappointing Guidance and Cautious Comments
Meta Platforms reported Q1 revenue of $36.4 billion versus analysts’ average estimate of $36.22 billion. EPS also came in at $4.71, well above the estimate for $4.32 per share.
However, the firm provided Q2 sales guidance of between $36.5 billion and $39 billion. The middle of that range comes in below analysts’ average outlook of $38.3 billion.
Meanwhile, the company raised its 2024 capital expenditure guidance to between $35 billion and $40 billion, up from its previous outlook of between $30 billion and $37 billion. Meta Platforms attributed the increase to its increased investments in artificial intelligence ( AI ).
Noting that Meta Platforms is “scaling a new product but [not] yet monetizing it,” Zuckerberg said that META stock has undergone a great deal of “volatility” during such periods of investment in the past. However, the CEO added that the firm will have multiple opportunities down the road to use AI to greatly improve its financial results.
The Mag 7’s Outlook
Meta Platforms’ guidance miss and spending hike could meaningfully dent investors’ belief in the impregnability of the Magnificent Seven. At the very least, three members of the group — Meta Platforms, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TESLA ) — are now largely out of favor with major investors.
But the problems with those stocks could boost other members of the Mag 7 and lift firms outside of the tech sector that have been rapidly growing, such as General Motors (NYSE: GM ) and Chipotle (NYSE: CMG ). Some tremendously beaten-down mid-cap and small-cap stocks could benefit from Mag 7 weakness as well.

2024-04-25,3 Tech Stocks to Sell Now Before the Next Market Downturn Hits,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
After leading the market higher coming out of the 2022 bear market, technology stocks have hit a rough patch. Sentiment towards the mega-cap tech companies has also shifted, as it now looks like interest rates will remain higher for longer.
At the same time, geopolitical instability and spiking bond yields have zapped investors’ risk appetite. Throw in hit-and-miss earnings reports and shifting consumer habits, and you have the makings of a downturn.
In the last month, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index has fallen 5%, with much of that decline coming since April 11. Some tech stocks have been hit worse than others, as signs emerge that their business may be slowing or the outlook for the remainder of the year has changed.
Wall Street appears to be bracing for more downside ahead, with some analysts calling for a full-blown 10% market correction . In this rapidly evolving environment, investors should reposition their portfolio and batten down the hatches.
Here are three tech stocks to sell now before the next market downturn hits.
Cadence Design Systems (CDNS)
Source: mrinalpal / Shutterstock.com
The stock of Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ: CDNS ) fell after the maker of semiconductor-design software issued forward guidance that fell short of Wall Street forecasts. Disappointing guidance is starting to become a theme at Cadence Design, which did the same thing in January of this year, sending its share price lower. CDNS stock is now up about 6% on the year, lagging the performance of many other semiconductor stocks .
The weak guidance is particularly frustrating, given that Cadence Design Systems consistently beats Wall Street expectations in its quarterly earnings. The company reported first quarter 2024 earnings per share of $1.17, which was better than the $1.13 expected among analysts. Revenue in Q1 totaled $1 billion, which was inline with forecasts. Cadence Design also said that it ended Q1 with a record backlog of $6 billion in orders.
Despite the earnings beat and record orders, management once again provided guidance below analysts’ expectations . The company now projects revenue of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion for the current second quarter, with earnings of $1.20 to $1.24 per share. Analysts had been looking for Q2 revenue of $1.10 billion and $1.43 a share in earnings. The weak outlook makes Cadence Design Systems a tech stock to sell.
Netflix (NFLX)
Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com
Don’t mess with the subscriber numbers. That was the takeaway from the Q1 print of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ). The streaming giant’s stock fell 10% after management announced that they will no longer report quarterly membership numbers and average revenue per membership.
Moreover, the leadership team said they are stopping the reporting of subscriber numbers , as they want investors to focus instead on metrics such as revenue, operating margins and free cash flow. That news did not go over well with investors.
More than a few analysts said the move is a red flag and a sign that subscriber growth is slowing at the world’s largest movie and TV streaming platform. Subscriber numbers have always been a way for analysts and investors to compare Netflix and its growth to competing streaming services, such as those offered by Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS ).
News that the reporting of subscribers will be ending at Netflix completely overshadowed what was otherwise a strong Q1 print from the company.
While NFLX stock is still up about 26% on the year, any signs of slowing subscriber growth are likely to be problematic for the company and its share price moving forward. As such, Netflix looks like a tech stock to sell before the next market downturn hits.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com
Of course, there are still reasons to like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), and the long-term outlook for the stock remains largely positive. But in the near-term, things are getting messy.
Each piece of news related to the consumer electronics company seems to be worse than the last. Case in point: Apple’s iPhone sales in China fell 19% during this year’s first quarter, according to data from Counterpoint Research. Another recent report claimed that Q1 iPhone sales in China declined 9.6%.
At the same time, media reports note that Apple’s senior executives have been selling millions of dollars worth of company stock ahead of the upcoming May 2 Q1 earnings.
Apple CEO Tim Cook has sold $33.3 million of Apple stock in April. While Apple has said that the stock sales were prearranged, seeing the executive team dump AAPL stock right before earnings as iPhone sales plunge is a bad look. It also puts more of a spotlight on Apple’s upcoming print, which is shaping up to be a make or break moment for the stock.

2024-04-25,3 Dow Stocks That Could Be Heading Six Feet Under,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The Dow 30 is a venerable group of blue-chip stocks known for their stability. So, it’s fair to say that none of these companies will cease to exist. But as investors know, market corrections can strike speculative and blue-chip stocks alike. That makes it look like it is time to focus on Dow stocks to sell.
The 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) stocks represent significant companies across various industries. However, as the last few years have shown, not every sector has always been a winner.
Consider the Magnificent 7 stocks, of which a couple are Dow components. These were the darlings of the market last year. But in 2024, not so much. And the Dow 30 is also loaded with some of the biggest consumer staples and consumer discretionary stocks . Those have been hit-and-miss for investors.
For long-term investors, many of these stocks are perfectly fine to hold onto for the long haul. Many of these stocks pay dividends that can help offset any short-term corrections with the stock. But if you’re a trader looking for short-term gains, these companies may not be it. Each one has short-term concerns that are likely to keep sellers in control.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Moab Republic / Shutterstock
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is one of the Magnificent 7 stocks I touched on in the introduction, but 2024 has been anything but magnificent for the tech stalwart. AAPL stock is down 13.5% for the year, and even with the stock near its 52-week low, the selling may not be done yet.
On April 23, an analyst report forecasted that iPhone sales in China dropped by 19.1%. The company is now in third place in smartphone sales in the country, the world’s largest smartphone market.
The larger issue for short-term investors is Apple’s lack of clarity about where it fits into the artificial intelligence ( AI ) space. Perhaps more details will be available at its June Worldwide Developer’s Conference .
But before that, the company will report earnings, and they are likely to disappoint. S&P Global Market Intelligence forecasts that Apple will be one of the only S&P 500 stocks to report a year-over-year (YOY) decline in earnings for the first quarter. If true, the estimated drop is less than 1%, but when investors are looking for any reason to sell the news, Apple has to be at least considered as one of the Dow stocks to sell.
Boeing (BA)
Source: Marco Menezes / Shutterstock.com
The problems at Boeing (NYSE: BA ) have become well-known. After closing out 2023 on a heater, BA stock is down 34% for the year, making it one of the leading Dow laggards. Some contrarian investors may believe the stock has become so bad it’s good. However, Boeing still belongs on a list of Dow stocks to sell.
That’s because the quality issues at Boeing can’t be dismissed as a one-off. Regulators are finding that this is a systemic problem. Of course, it can be fixed, and likely in short order. But at what cost to earnings? One of the reasons why quality control got away from Boeing was because it had become efficient at outsourcing much of the work to make parts. This is a fix that will expose shareholders to some short-term pain.
Current CEO Dave Calhoun is leaving the company in December. Whether Calhoun was responsible for the problem or not, that was a move that had to be made for the company’s reputation. It’s also worth noting that Boeing does play a role in the emerging space economy. But that’s not why the company is making headlines. Loose screws and door panels are. Until that changes, and with no dividend to reward your patience, it’s best to sit this out.
Disney (DIS)
Source: Walt Disney Co
Speaking of stocks that got so bad, they were good, which brings to mind Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS ). The company had a disastrous 2022 and 2023 as the sum-of-its-parts narrative that had been such a benefit fell apart.
Theme park revenue indeed remains strong. However, Disney faces real challenges in making all parts of the business run like a well-oiled machine. The largest example is its Disney+ streaming service, narrowing its losses, but that’s not the same as saying the company is profitable. And since the “growth” comes from cost-cutting measures, it’s fair to wonder what happens if the streaming business is as good as it gets in terms of profit.
The company’s fourth quarter and full-year earnings report may have been a good first step. And it’s good to have the proxy battle between CEO Bob Iger and activist investor Normal Peltz behind it. But does it justify having DIS stock up 24% for the year? That’s what investors will have to decide.

The Chinese economy has been in a bit of a rough patch for quite some time now, with numerous Chinese tech titans still stuck in their massive multi-year ruts. Even the U.S. companies that do a significant amount of business in China have been feeling the harsh economic realities. Add the potential for geopolitical risks into the equation, and it can feel tempting to steer clear of the companies that may depend too much on the region to fuel their long-term revenue growth.
That said, there is hope, with China starting the year with 5.3% growth in the first quarter. For those willing to bet on a Chinese economic rebound, I view the U.S. companies with exposure to the region as great plays.
Longer-term investors seeking low-cost growth may find ample value in buying some Chinese-exposed U.S. firms while they’re down and out. Here are three underperforming U.S. stocks that could benefit greatly once China’s economy finally has a chance to bounce back.
Starbucks (SBUX)

Chinese consumers seem to have a newfound thirst for coffee. Indeed, tea has nothing on coffee when it comes to getting a nice caffeinated jolt to start one’s day. China has seen robust growth in cafés in recent years, with the nation now boasting more branded coffee shops than America, a fact I found quite surprising.
Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) is the branded coffee kingpin that’s done a good job of expanding into China in recent years. However, the Chinese coffee boom has also paved the way for national competitors. In any case, growth out of China could be key to boosting SBUX stock to new highs over the next few years.
In the meantime, Starbucks has no shortage of problems, as budget-constrained consumers pull back on fancy Frappuccinos for homemade brews. As inflation dies down and Starbucks continues opening new shops across China, I view shares as having a pathway out of the gutter under its new top boss Laxman Narasimhan.
Apple (AAPL)

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is another company that could rocket higher once the Chinese economy kicks into high gear. With China’s economy off to a decent start to the year, the world’s second-largest economy may very well be in a spot to make up for lost time in the quarters ahead. That could spell great things for Apple as it looks to gain ground in the region again.
With Chinese smartphone rivals, like Xiaomi (OTCMKTS: XIACY ) and Huawei , beginning to pick up speed, many wonder if Apple still has what it takes to capitalize on next-level growth out of China. Earlier this year, Apple reportedly offered a rare discount on its latest iPhone to bolster sales growth in China. However, only time will tell how the iPhone will stack up against domestic competitors over the year ahead.
I think it’s a mistake to discount Apple’s ability to return to glory once the Chinese economy is back up to full speed. At the end of the day, the iPhone is a premium device, one that could experience more explosive demand when Chinese consumers have more disposable income.
Even if growth in China stalls for longer, Apple still stands to do well as it begins to share more about its long-term AI strategy with the world. With intriguing AI products (AI PCs and phones rumored to be on the way) and software updates in the pipeline, AAPL has plenty of growth drivers to jolt its stock.
LVMH (LVMUY)
Source: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com
Finally, we have luxury goods maker LVMH (OTCMKTS: LVMUY ), which found itself plunging around 11% off its year-to-date highs. With sales growth coming in soft as a result of lower demand for luxury goods in China, the stock seems destined for lower lows as its most exciting growth market feels a bit of a pinch.
I view the slip in LMVH stock as a terrific buying opportunity for investors seeking to ride the next Chinese economic recovery. Undoubtedly, luxury demand is bound to swing wildly based on the health of the economy. But when the tides finally do turn, they could do so drastically. For now, it’s unclear as to when luxury demand will start making a move to peak levels. Regardless, LVMH will be there to meet pent-up demand when the time comes.
At 26.6 times trailing P/E, the stock looks way too cheap, given after the latest round of turbulent action. Undoubtedly, China is becoming an increasingly important growth market for LVMH as it looks to capitalize on the nation’s rising middle class. Even as demand sags, I have no doubt that LVMH will continue increasing its Asian store count at a steady pace over the next few years.

2024-04-24,3 Non-Gamestop Stocks to Buy for the Future of Gaming,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
As gaming stocks have a bright future, investors should tap into this industry now while the valuation of these companies are still cheap.
The global video game market size was valued at approximately $217.06 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 13.4% from 2023 to 2030. This growth is largely driven by advancements in online gaming.
Online gaming dominates the market, attributed to increased internet penetration and the popularity of massively multiplayer online and free-to-play games.

Moreover, the industry is seeing a shift towards subscription-based models, with platforms like Xbox Game Pass by Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Apple Arcade.
This means that the gaming industry is becoming more lucrative due to some of these firms being evaluated the same as tech stocks are, due to their monthly recurring revenue streams.
We might be at an inflection point soon when these companies take off. So here are three gaming stocks for investors to consider.
Roblox (RBLX)
Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com
Roblox (NYSE: RBLX ) has proven to be a resilient name in the gaming industry, and it has only just begun to mark its dominance in the industry.
Unlike traditional gaming platforms that rely on a set catalog of games, Roblox allows users to create and monetize their own gaming experiences.
Starting out as a gaming platform for kids, it has since considerably broadened its demographic and expanded its monetization features. This includes the expansion of its developer subscription services and advertising programs, which saw substantial brand engagements with 69 major brands in Q4 2023.
Additionally, the company is enhancing its platform with new AI-driven features, such as real-time AI chat translation and AI-powered tools for 3D content creation.
Given how many dedicated communities on Roblox there are and its expanding monthly recurring revenue, Roblox will be in a great position to scale its userbase in the future and reach higher levels of profitability. This then makes it one of those gaming stocks to buy.
Unity Software Inc (U)
Source: viewimage / Shutterstock.com
Unity Software Inc (NYSE: U ) dominates the game engine market, especially for mobile games, and also has significant shares in PC and VR and AR markets.
It should also be noted that Unity is a popular game engine of indie developers. So, even if one has a less bullish forecast on AAA publishers’ ability to outperform, Unity covers one-man bands, as well as small teams. Mobile gaming is its obvious strength, and VR and AR are strong potential growth areas.
For 2024, Unity is concentrating on expanding its core business areas , including enhancing AI integration within its development tools and launching new multiplayer projects.
Unity 6, a major update, is set to launch in fall 2024, promising improved performance and expanded features for developers. Additionally, Unity Muse, an AI-powered development platform, will be integrated directly into the Unity Editor.
Finally, the consensus price target among analysts is $37.03 for Unity to be reached within the next twelve months, which represents a potential upside of 61.64% from its current price.
Electronic Arts (EA)
Source: Rick Neves / Shutterstock.com
Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA ) is a major player in video game development and publishing, known for popular titles across various genres like sports, such as FIFA and Madden NFL, first-person shooters and simulation games.
Although some committed gamers point out EA’s reputation for rehashing the same games every year, as in the case for its blockbuster sports franchises, combined with the morally debatable practice of loot boxes and pay-to-win dynamics, EA has managed to stand the test of time as a business.
EA also recently adjusted its workforce, reducing it by 6% and implementing restructuring charges expected to range from $170 million to $200 million. This move aligns with broader industry trends — a smaller team in the future is why you should be bullish on EA.
EA forecasts net revenue to range between $7.3 billion and $7.7 billion this year, and net income is projected between $947 million and $1.087 billion. Diluted earnings per share are expected to lie between $3.42 and $3.92. This puts it around the results of last year, but the efficiencies of having a smaller workforce could unlock greater value in the long run.

2024-04-23,Warning! These 3 Blue-Chip Stocks Will Have You Seeing Red,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Not all stocks have succeeded in the bull market that began about 18 months ago. In the current market , a rising tide has not lifted all boats. In fact, there are some very notable names that are currently on the decline. Who would have predicted a year ago that names such as electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and consumer electronics giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) would be down by double digits and badly lagging the benchmark S&P 500 index?
Yet this is the case as the competitive landscape and consumer trends have shifted. Once true blue stocks and reliable brands can no longer be trusted to deliver outsized gains to shareholders and surpass market returns. As such, investors are having to adjust their thinking and reevaluate their approach to stock picking. Here at InvestorPlace, we aim to help and offer the following warning. These three clue-chip stocks will have you seeing red. Avoid them at all costs.
Johnson & Johnson
Source: Raihana Asral / Shutterstock.com
Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson’s (NYSE: JNJ ) stock has been a crushing disappointment for a long time. In the last 12 months, JNJ stock has declined nearly 10%, including a 6% drop this year. Through five years, the share price has gained a paltry 7%. Litigation related to its talc baby powder has weighed heavily on the stock. So too have middling financial results and a costly restructuring that hived off the company’s underperforming consumer healthcare products such as its shampoo.
Johnson & Johnson just reported its first quarter 2024 financial results , and they were once again mixed. Earnings per share ( EPS ) of $2.71 beat analyst expectations of $2.64. However, revenue in the quarter came in at $21.38 billion compared to $21.40 billion that was forecast on Wall Street. Johnson & Johnson got a slight boost from its medical device business, where sales rose 4% from a year ago. However, the company lowered its full-year guidance, narrowing both its sales and profit outlooks. Wall Street was not impressed.
AT&T (T)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
Shares of legacy telecommunications firm AT&T (NYSE: T ) have been firmly in the red for years now. Over the past five years, T stock had decreased 30%. So far in 2024, the company’s share price has slid 6% lower. Even a rock bottom valuation of eight times future earnings estimates and a quarterly dividend that yields 6.81% isn’t enough to attract investors. The company, which remains the biggest wireless carrier in America, has careened from one disaster to another for the better part of a decade.
The latest terrible news to drag T stock lower are reports that millions of its customers’ data was published on the infamous “dark web,” a corner of the Internet that can only be accessed using special software. AT&T said it is actively contacting more than 7.5 million impacted active customers, along with 65 million former account holders. The leak apparently involves data from 2019 and includes personal information such as names, home addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers. Ouch!
Lululemon Athletica (LULU)
Source: lentamart / Shutterstock
Down nearly 30% on the year, shares of Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: LULU ) are among the worst performing in the S&P 500 currently. In fact, as of this writing, LULU stock is the fifth worst performing stock listed on the benchmark index. The share price has been sliding lower ever since the athletic apparel company reported earnings in March that showed its North American sales slowing . The company reported that its Q4 2023 sales rose 9% in North America compared to 29% growth a year earlier.
Lululemon also announced that, owing t0 declining sales, it is closing a distribution center in Washington state and eliminating 128 jobs. The company said it decided to close the distribution center as part of a re-evaluation of its network in the U.S. and Canada. The closure comes after Lululemon provided weak guidance, saying that for all of this year it expects sales of $10.70 billion to $10.80 billion compared with estimates of $10.90 billion. Profits are forecast at $14 to $14.20 a share compared to a $14.13 estimate on Wall Street.

2024-04-25,3 Dow Stocks That Could Be Heading Six Feet Under,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The Dow 30 is a venerable group of blue-chip stocks known for their stability. So, it’s fair to say that none of these companies will cease to exist. But as investors know, market corrections can strike speculative and blue-chip stocks alike. That makes it look like it is time to focus on Dow stocks to sell.
The 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) stocks represent significant companies across various industries. However, as the last few years have shown, not every sector has always been a winner.
Consider the Magnificent 7 stocks, of which a couple are Dow components. These were the darlings of the market last year. But in 2024, not so much. And the Dow 30 is also loaded with some of the biggest consumer staples and consumer discretionary stocks . Those have been hit-and-miss for investors.
For long-term investors, many of these stocks are perfectly fine to hold onto for the long haul. Many of these stocks pay dividends that can help offset any short-term corrections with the stock. But if you’re a trader looking for short-term gains, these companies may not be it. Each one has short-term concerns that are likely to keep sellers in control.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Moab Republic / Shutterstock
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is one of the Magnificent 7 stocks I touched on in the introduction, but 2024 has been anything but magnificent for the tech stalwart. AAPL stock is down 13.5% for the year, and even with the stock near its 52-week low, the selling may not be done yet.
On April 23, an analyst report forecasted that iPhone sales in China dropped by 19.1%. The company is now in third place in smartphone sales in the country, the world’s largest smartphone market.
The larger issue for short-term investors is Apple’s lack of clarity about where it fits into the artificial intelligence ( AI ) space. Perhaps more details will be available at its June Worldwide Developer’s Conference .
But before that, the company will report earnings, and they are likely to disappoint. S&P Global Market Intelligence forecasts that Apple will be one of the only S&P 500 stocks to report a year-over-year (YOY) decline in earnings for the first quarter. If true, the estimated drop is less than 1%, but when investors are looking for any reason to sell the news, Apple has to be at least considered as one of the Dow stocks to sell.
Boeing (BA)
Source: Marco Menezes / Shutterstock.com
The problems at Boeing (NYSE: BA ) have become well-known. After closing out 2023 on a heater, BA stock is down 34% for the year, making it one of the leading Dow laggards. Some contrarian investors may believe the stock has become so bad it’s good. However, Boeing still belongs on a list of Dow stocks to sell.
That’s because the quality issues at Boeing can’t be dismissed as a one-off. Regulators are finding that this is a systemic problem. Of course, it can be fixed, and likely in short order. But at what cost to earnings? One of the reasons why quality control got away from Boeing was because it had become efficient at outsourcing much of the work to make parts. This is a fix that will expose shareholders to some short-term pain.
Current CEO Dave Calhoun is leaving the company in December. Whether Calhoun was responsible for the problem or not, that was a move that had to be made for the company’s reputation. It’s also worth noting that Boeing does play a role in the emerging space economy. But that’s not why the company is making headlines. Loose screws and door panels are. Until that changes, and with no dividend to reward your patience, it’s best to sit this out.
Disney (DIS)
Source: Walt Disney Co
Speaking of stocks that got so bad, they were good, which brings to mind Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS ). The company had a disastrous 2022 and 2023 as the sum-of-its-parts narrative that had been such a benefit fell apart.
Theme park revenue indeed remains strong. However, Disney faces real challenges in making all parts of the business run like a well-oiled machine. The largest example is its Disney+ streaming service, narrowing its losses, but that’s not the same as saying the company is profitable. And since the “growth” comes from cost-cutting measures, it’s fair to wonder what happens if the streaming business is as good as it gets in terms of profit.
The company’s fourth quarter and full-year earnings report may have been a good first step. And it’s good to have the proxy battle between CEO Bob Iger and activist investor Normal Peltz behind it. But does it justify having DIS stock up 24% for the year? That’s what investors will have to decide.

We think prudence is justified from here, as valuations have expanded, and robust economic activity makes the pace and magnitude of near-term rate cuts somewhat suspect.
Stocks in ""hot"" areas such as AI—even when ultimately worthy of the excitement—can experience expectation adjustments along the way.
Investing Environment
As we entered 2024, equity markets moved higher in anticipation of the US economy experiencing a Goldilocks scenario-soft landing combined with falling inflation-that would lead the Fed to cut interest rates. Overall, the US economy continues to show remarkable resilience in the face of elevated interest rates, with solid consumer spending and low unemployment. However, we note that evidence of cracks in the economy are emerging, such as rising credit card debt and auto loan delinquencies.

We discuss several reasons why paying a dividend can help a stock deliver better returns than it would otherwise over the long term.
We also share why VIG could be an excellent vehicle for gaining exposure to these benefits of a dividend stock.
A common sentiment among many investors on Seeking Alpha today is that if total returns are your primary objective, you should forget about dividend stocks and invest heavily in tech stocks like Nvidia ( NVDA ) and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), perhaps with an allocation to prominent companies like Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.A )( BRK.B ) as well, to maximize your total returns over the long term.

2024-04-24,3 Underperforming U.S. Stocks With Big China Upside,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The Chinese economy has been in a bit of a rough patch for quite some time now, with numerous Chinese tech titans still stuck in their massive multi-year ruts. Even the U.S. companies that do a significant amount of business in China have been feeling the harsh economic realities. Add the potential for geopolitical risks into the equation, and it can feel tempting to steer clear of the companies that may depend too much on the region to fuel their long-term revenue growth.
That said, there is hope, with China starting the year with 5.3% growth in the first quarter. For those willing to bet on a Chinese economic rebound, I view the U.S. companies with exposure to the region as great plays.
Longer-term investors seeking low-cost growth may find ample value in buying some Chinese-exposed U.S. firms while they’re down and out. Here are three underperforming U.S. stocks that could benefit greatly once China’s economy finally has a chance to bounce back.
Starbucks (SBUX)

Chinese consumers seem to have a newfound thirst for coffee. Indeed, tea has nothing on coffee when it comes to getting a nice caffeinated jolt to start one’s day. China has seen robust growth in cafés in recent years, with the nation now boasting more branded coffee shops than America, a fact I found quite surprising.
Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) is the branded coffee kingpin that’s done a good job of expanding into China in recent years. However, the Chinese coffee boom has also paved the way for national competitors. In any case, growth out of China could be key to boosting SBUX stock to new highs over the next few years.
In the meantime, Starbucks has no shortage of problems, as budget-constrained consumers pull back on fancy Frappuccinos for homemade brews. As inflation dies down and Starbucks continues opening new shops across China, I view shares as having a pathway out of the gutter under its new top boss Laxman Narasimhan.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is another company that could rocket higher once the Chinese economy kicks into high gear. With China’s economy off to a decent start to the year, the world’s second-largest economy may very well be in a spot to make up for lost time in the quarters ahead. That could spell great things for Apple as it looks to gain ground in the region again.
With Chinese smartphone rivals, like Xiaomi (OTCMKTS: XIACY ) and Huawei , beginning to pick up speed, many wonder if Apple still has what it takes to capitalize on next-level growth out of China. Earlier this year, Apple reportedly offered a rare discount on its latest iPhone to bolster sales growth in China. However, only time will tell how the iPhone will stack up against domestic competitors over the year ahead.
I think it’s a mistake to discount Apple’s ability to return to glory once the Chinese economy is back up to full speed. At the end of the day, the iPhone is a premium device, one that could experience more explosive demand when Chinese consumers have more disposable income.
Even if growth in China stalls for longer, Apple still stands to do well as it begins to share more about its long-term AI strategy with the world. With intriguing AI products (AI PCs and phones rumored to be on the way) and software updates in the pipeline, AAPL has plenty of growth drivers to jolt its stock.
LVMH (LVMUY)
Source: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com
Finally, we have luxury goods maker LVMH (OTCMKTS: LVMUY ), which found itself plunging around 11% off its year-to-date highs. With sales growth coming in soft as a result of lower demand for luxury goods in China, the stock seems destined for lower lows as its most exciting growth market feels a bit of a pinch.
I view the slip in LMVH stock as a terrific buying opportunity for investors seeking to ride the next Chinese economic recovery. Undoubtedly, luxury demand is bound to swing wildly based on the health of the economy. But when the tides finally do turn, they could do so drastically. For now, it’s unclear as to when luxury demand will start making a move to peak levels. Regardless, LVMH will be there to meet pent-up demand when the time comes.
At 26.6 times trailing P/E, the stock looks way too cheap, given after the latest round of turbulent action. Undoubtedly, China is becoming an increasingly important growth market for LVMH as it looks to capitalize on the nation’s rising middle class. Even as demand sags, I have no doubt that LVMH will continue increasing its Asian store count at a steady pace over the next few years.

2024-04-24,3 Non-Gamestop Stocks to Buy for the Future of Gaming,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
As gaming stocks have a bright future, investors should tap into this industry now while the valuation of these companies are still cheap.
The global video game market size was valued at approximately $217.06 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 13.4% from 2023 to 2030. This growth is largely driven by advancements in online gaming.
Online gaming dominates the market, attributed to increased internet penetration and the popularity of massively multiplayer online and free-to-play games.

Moreover, the industry is seeing a shift towards subscription-based models, with platforms like Xbox Game Pass by Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Apple Arcade.
This means that the gaming industry is becoming more lucrative due to some of these firms being evaluated the same as tech stocks are, due to their monthly recurring revenue streams.
We might be at an inflection point soon when these companies take off. So here are three gaming stocks for investors to consider.
Roblox (RBLX)
Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com
Roblox (NYSE: RBLX ) has proven to be a resilient name in the gaming industry, and it has only just begun to mark its dominance in the industry.
Unlike traditional gaming platforms that rely on a set catalog of games, Roblox allows users to create and monetize their own gaming experiences.
Starting out as a gaming platform for kids, it has since considerably broadened its demographic and expanded its monetization features. This includes the expansion of its developer subscription services and advertising programs, which saw substantial brand engagements with 69 major brands in Q4 2023.
Additionally, the company is enhancing its platform with new AI-driven features, such as real-time AI chat translation and AI-powered tools for 3D content creation.
Given how many dedicated communities on Roblox there are and its expanding monthly recurring revenue, Roblox will be in a great position to scale its userbase in the future and reach higher levels of profitability. This then makes it one of those gaming stocks to buy.
Unity Software Inc (U)
Source: viewimage / Shutterstock.com
Unity Software Inc (NYSE: U ) dominates the game engine market, especially for mobile games, and also has significant shares in PC and VR and AR markets.
It should also be noted that Unity is a popular game engine of indie developers. So, even if one has a less bullish forecast on AAA publishers’ ability to outperform, Unity covers one-man bands, as well as small teams. Mobile gaming is its obvious strength, and VR and AR are strong potential growth areas.
For 2024, Unity is concentrating on expanding its core business areas , including enhancing AI integration within its development tools and launching new multiplayer projects.
Unity 6, a major update, is set to launch in fall 2024, promising improved performance and expanded features for developers. Additionally, Unity Muse, an AI-powered development platform, will be integrated directly into the Unity Editor.
Finally, the consensus price target among analysts is $37.03 for Unity to be reached within the next twelve months, which represents a potential upside of 61.64% from its current price.
Electronic Arts (EA)
Source: Rick Neves / Shutterstock.com
Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA ) is a major player in video game development and publishing, known for popular titles across various genres like sports, such as FIFA and Madden NFL, first-person shooters and simulation games.
Although some committed gamers point out EA’s reputation for rehashing the same games every year, as in the case for its blockbuster sports franchises, combined with the morally debatable practice of loot boxes and pay-to-win dynamics, EA has managed to stand the test of time as a business.
EA also recently adjusted its workforce, reducing it by 6% and implementing restructuring charges expected to range from $170 million to $200 million. This move aligns with broader industry trends — a smaller team in the future is why you should be bullish on EA.
EA forecasts net revenue to range between $7.3 billion and $7.7 billion this year, and net income is projected between $947 million and $1.087 billion. Diluted earnings per share are expected to lie between $3.42 and $3.92. This puts it around the results of last year, but the efficiencies of having a smaller workforce could unlock greater value in the long run.

2024-04-23,Warning! These 3 Blue-Chip Stocks Will Have You Seeing Red,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Not all stocks have succeeded in the bull market that began about 18 months ago. In the current market , a rising tide has not lifted all boats. In fact, there are some very notable names that are currently on the decline. Who would have predicted a year ago that names such as electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and consumer electronics giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) would be down by double digits and badly lagging the benchmark S&P 500 index?
Yet this is the case as the competitive landscape and consumer trends have shifted. Once true blue stocks and reliable brands can no longer be trusted to deliver outsized gains to shareholders and surpass market returns. As such, investors are having to adjust their thinking and reevaluate their approach to stock picking. Here at InvestorPlace, we aim to help and offer the following warning. These three clue-chip stocks will have you seeing red. Avoid them at all costs.
Johnson & Johnson
Source: Raihana Asral / Shutterstock.com
Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson’s (NYSE: JNJ ) stock has been a crushing disappointment for a long time. In the last 12 months, JNJ stock has declined nearly 10%, including a 6% drop this year. Through five years, the share price has gained a paltry 7%. Litigation related to its talc baby powder has weighed heavily on the stock. So too have middling financial results and a costly restructuring that hived off the company’s underperforming consumer healthcare products such as its shampoo.
Johnson & Johnson just reported its first quarter 2024 financial results , and they were once again mixed. Earnings per share ( EPS ) of $2.71 beat analyst expectations of $2.64. However, revenue in the quarter came in at $21.38 billion compared to $21.40 billion that was forecast on Wall Street. Johnson & Johnson got a slight boost from its medical device business, where sales rose 4% from a year ago. However, the company lowered its full-year guidance, narrowing both its sales and profit outlooks. Wall Street was not impressed.
AT&T (T)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
Shares of legacy telecommunications firm AT&T (NYSE: T ) have been firmly in the red for years now. Over the past five years, T stock had decreased 30%. So far in 2024, the company’s share price has slid 6% lower. Even a rock bottom valuation of eight times future earnings estimates and a quarterly dividend that yields 6.81% isn’t enough to attract investors. The company, which remains the biggest wireless carrier in America, has careened from one disaster to another for the better part of a decade.
The latest terrible news to drag T stock lower are reports that millions of its customers’ data was published on the infamous “dark web,” a corner of the Internet that can only be accessed using special software. AT&T said it is actively contacting more than 7.5 million impacted active customers, along with 65 million former account holders. The leak apparently involves data from 2019 and includes personal information such as names, home addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers. Ouch!
Lululemon Athletica (LULU)
Source: lentamart / Shutterstock
Down nearly 30% on the year, shares of Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: LULU ) are among the worst performing in the S&P 500 currently. In fact, as of this writing, LULU stock is the fifth worst performing stock listed on the benchmark index. The share price has been sliding lower ever since the athletic apparel company reported earnings in March that showed its North American sales slowing . The company reported that its Q4 2023 sales rose 9% in North America compared to 29% growth a year earlier.
Lululemon also announced that, owing t0 declining sales, it is closing a distribution center in Washington state and eliminating 128 jobs. The company said it decided to close the distribution center as part of a re-evaluation of its network in the U.S. and Canada. The closure comes after Lululemon provided weak guidance, saying that for all of this year it expects sales of $10.70 billion to $10.80 billion compared with estimates of $10.90 billion. Profits are forecast at $14 to $14.20 a share compared to a $14.13 estimate on Wall Street.

The market has been choppy as CPI came in hotter than expected, and Fed Chair Powell started to tone down the expectations of rate cuts and is discussing being data-dependent again. Tensions between Israel and Iran continue to be unstable as both sides have taken a shot at each other. The oil markets seem to have calmed down as Brent fell back below $90, but if the situation escalates, $100 per barrel could become a reality. Netflix ( NFLX ) fell -9.09% after earnings as it decided to no longer report subscriber numbers starting in Q1 2025, while Nvidia ( NVDA ) -10% on Friday to lead the markets lower. The Invesco QQQ ETF ( QQQ ) closed the week, falling -5.96% , while the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ( SPY ) shed -3.79% . I think the market overreacted to the commentary regarding NFLX, as their Q1 2024 earnings were strong, and I believe big tech minus TSLA will likely shine this earnings season. This is why I am adding to my position in the NEOS Nasdaq-100 High Income ETF (QQQI), as it followed the market lower this week, with shares declining by -5.39%. I am a big fan of the products that NEOS has launched and feel this is an opportunity to add some additional income with QQQI. While QQQI is a newer product with just $110.13 million in assets under management ((AUM)) and two declared distributions, the Neos S&P 500 High Income ETF ( SPY I) has provided a blueprint of what to expect after exceeding $1 billion in AUM and a double-digit yield over the trailing twelve months ((TTM))....",27

2024-04-23,Palantir Stock at a Crossroads: Analyzing the Risks and Rewards for Investors,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
I have been down on Palantir stock (NASDAQ: PLTR ) for some time.
It is, at its heart, a government contractor. Calling it an AI stock doesn’t change that.
Military contracting is a profitable but slow-growth business. Palantir brought almost 10% of last year’s $2.25 billion in revenue to the bottom line.
The question is always whether it can do better, or grow faster, given the constraints of its business model. Like a political consulting firm, it can only play on one side of the street.
I’m glad it’s our side.
Palantir’s Commercial Arm
The bull case for Palantir stock has always been built on its commercial contracts .
Palantir has been doing well in hospitals, planning and scheduling people and equipment.
It makes sense. Hospitals need data security. Palantir’s software can anticipate demand and plan accordingly, faster than people can. It’s not just replacing whiteboards and spreadsheets. It is very much a Machine Internet application.
Now Palantir is exploring a new niche, ad agencies. The idea is that it can use inventory and demand data to optimize ad campaigns, buying ads and adjusting prices to maximize clients’ return. It’s bringing tools first written for logistics into sales and marketing. It’s getting a hearing.
This may be why the asset manager for Norway’s biggest bank recently cut his positions in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) to buy more Palantir. Bruce Kamich of TheStreet recently hiked his price target to $48 per share. This helped the stock stay hot during the first quarter, rising by over one-third.
But since April began, it’s down 19%.
The Bear Claw
AI is one of those Internet buzzwords that make you swoon.
But isn’t Palantir getting a little ahead of itself, our Louis Navillier asks? Growth isn’t accelerating, nor is it expected to. It will certainly be profitable this year, and could be added to the S&P 500 at any time , forcing index funds to buy it.
But even if Palantir hits its top earnings estimate of 41 cents per share, you’re paying 49 times that to own it. That’s based on April 19’s closing price of $20.31.
The nosebleed valuation has some analysts downgrading the stock. Hype cycles, and AI is a hype cycle, are fragile things. Technologies always disappoint before they show their value.
Palantir’s Key Ally
While Palantir drew early interest by working with Cloud Czars like Microsoft, its alliance with Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL ) may be more important.
The two companies are sympatico on a deep level. Oracle was late to the cloud because it remains highly proprietary. Palantir is also highly proprietary.
But getting in late beats not getting in at all. Over the last 2 years Oracle stock is up 50% on the strength of its cloud. Its market cap is up to $315 billion. The deal also puts a floor under Palantir stock. If it falls, Oracle could buy it.
The Bottom Line
The wars in Ukraine and Gaza are very, very good news for Palantir. So is the rise of China. It’s prepared to exploit that through former Congressman Mike Gallagher, one of its new hires.
War is unhealthy for economies and other living things. It’s also very good for military contractors, especially those on the cutting edge like Palantir.
But getting Palantir stock to $48/share, or even $30, depends a lot more on its commercial arm than its military wing.
I wouldn’t rush to buy Palantir here. The recent wobble in AI semiconductor stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) may spread. But keep it in mind the next time animal spirits are feeding your view of the market. The long-term view of the business is positive.

2024-04-23,3 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy at a 52-Week Low in April,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
A lot of well-known blue-chip stocks that previously dominated their respective industries are struggling this year. One need only look at the year-to-date performance of the benchmark S&P 500 index to see many notable names deep in the red so far in 2024. Companies such as Nike (NYSE: NKE ), Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), just to name a few, continue to slide lower. The situation has only gotten worse as the entire market declines to start the year’s second quarter.
While concerning, and no doubt frustrating for existing shareholders, the continued drawdown presents an opportunity for investors to take new positions in some great stocks at or near their 52-week lows . Many of these top-shelf companies can be counted on to eventually rebound once their earnings strengthen, the operating environment improves, and market sentiment turns optimistic. In the meantime, investors have an opportunity to buy low in hopes of eventually selling high.
Here are three blue-chip stocks to buy at a 52-week low in April.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com
It seems strange to say, but Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is now trading right around its 52-week low, having declined nearly 15% on the year. AAPL stock is also negative over the last 12 months (down 0.01%), meaning it has erased all of its gains from the 2023 bull market. In what might be a bad omen for the company’s upcoming earnings report on May 2, media reports tell us that CEO Tim Cook and other senior executives have sold more than $70 million of company stock in April as the share price has steadily fallen.
CEO Cook has sold $33.3 million of Apple stock so far in April at an average price of $169.33 per share. Cook sold AAPL stock 12% below its peak of $192.53 reached in December 2023. At the same time, Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri, and Deirdre O’Brien, Senior Vice-President of Retail, also sold millions of dollars of Apple stock . This as International Data Corp. (IDC) reports that Apple’s iPhones shipments in the first quarter fell 9.6% from a year ago.
Also weighing on AAPL stock is the Department of Justice’s antitrust case against the technology giant, alleging that it violated federal law to preserve its position in the smartphone market. While there’s currently a buying opportunity with Apple’s stock, it might get even better after the company’s Q1 print in a few weeks.
Boeing Co. (BA)
Source: vaalaa / Shutterstock
For investors with a long time horizon, there is embattled airplane manufacturer Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA ). Having fallen 35% since January, BA stock is not only at a 52-week low, but is currently the third worst performing company in the S&P 500 index this year. Only Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Globe Life (NYSE: GL ), which has been accused of fraud , have performed worse than Boeing. However, while down, Boeing is likely to be far from out-given that it is one of only two major commercial aircraft manufacturers in the world.
Still, the pain for Boeing shareholders is likely to get worse before it gets better. The latest bad news is that airplane deliveries plunged in Q1 to their lowest level since the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021. Boeing has faced increased safety reviews by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) after a door plug blew off one of its 737 Max 9 airplanes in January. Consequently, Boeing delivered 83 new airplanes to customers in Q1, down 47% from 157 deliveries in the previous quarter.
As with Apple, Boeing’s stock could drop further after the company reports its Q1 financial results on April 24. But for long-term investors, the current share price decline could be a solid buying opportunity.
Spirit Airlines (SAVE)
Source: Markus Mainka / Shutterstock.com
Another aviation stock that is right near its 52-week low and struggling right now is Spirit Airlines (NYSE: SAVE ). Down 75% on the year, SAVE stock is now trading under $5 a share, putting it in penny stock territory. The steep selloff comes after JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ: JBLU ) pulled out of a deal to purchase the discount carrier for $3.8 billion, and amid a Pratt & Whitney engine recall. Spirit Airlines announced that it is deferring new aircraft purchases and laying off 260 pilots as it struggles with a liquidity problem.
While not without risk, SAVE stock could be worth a gamble now that its stock has fallen so much and is trading near rock bottom prices. The company appears to be doing all it can to conserve cash and improve its liquidity. Specifically, Spirit Airlines is deferring all aircraft orders, pushing them out as far as 2031. The budget airline is also furloughing the pilots. The combined moves will boost its liquidity by about $340 million over the next two years. And who knows, in that time another buyer may emerge for Spirit Airlines.

I plan to add NEOS Nasdaq-100 High Income ETF (QQQI) due to its potential for income generation and capital appreciation.
What a week it's been. We're heading into the biggest two weeks of earnings season as six of the Magnificent Seven are scheduled to report. Tesla (TSLA), Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Microsoft ( MSFT ) will deliver their Q1 2024 earnings this week, while Apple ( AAPL ) and Amazon ( AMZN ) will report the following week.

Tensions between Israel and Iran continue to be unstable as both sides have taken a shot at each other. The oil markets seem to have calmed down as Brent fell back below $90, but if the situation escalates, $100 per barrel could become a reality. Netflix ( NFLX ) fell -9.09% after earnings as it decided to no longer report subscriber numbers starting in Q1 2025, while Nvidia ( NVDA ) -10% on Friday to lead the markets lower. The Invesco QQQ ETF ( QQQ ) closed the week, falling -5.96% , while the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ( SPY ) shed -3.79% .

I am a big fan of the products that NEOS has launched and feel this is an opportunity to add some additional income with QQQI.

2024-04-23,AGD: Global Equity Fund With An 8.5% Yield And A Large Discount,"abrdn Global Dynamic Dividend Fund aims to capture more than its fair share of dividends via rotation among stocks.
The fund aims to provide investors with regular income and long-term capital growth.
We look at the setup and give you our take.
The Fund
abrdn Global Dynamic Dividend Fund ( AGD ) targets high income as its primary goal, with long-term capital gain playing second fiddle. A glance at the fund's recently published top holdings could have one scratching their head about its primary objective. The list is not exactly known for doling out the dough, and the average dividend yield is fairly small, even if you exclude the one that does not pay....",28

2024-04-23,Palantir Stock at a Crossroads: Analyzing the Risks and Rewards for Investors,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
I have been down on Palantir stock (NASDAQ: PLTR ) for some time.
It is, at its heart, a government contractor. Calling it an AI stock doesn’t change that.
Military contracting is a profitable but slow-growth business. Palantir brought almost 10% of last year’s $2.25 billion in revenue to the bottom line.
The question is always whether it can do better, or grow faster, given the constraints of its business model. Like a political consulting firm, it can only play on one side of the street.
I’m glad it’s our side.
Palantir’s Commercial Arm
The bull case for Palantir stock has always been built on its commercial contracts .
Palantir has been doing well in hospitals, planning and scheduling people and equipment.
It makes sense. Hospitals need data security. Palantir’s software can anticipate demand and plan accordingly, faster than people can. It’s not just replacing whiteboards and spreadsheets. It is very much a Machine Internet application.
Now Palantir is exploring a new niche, ad agencies. The idea is that it can use inventory and demand data to optimize ad campaigns, buying ads and adjusting prices to maximize clients’ return. It’s bringing tools first written for logistics into sales and marketing. It’s getting a hearing.
This may be why the asset manager for Norway’s biggest bank recently cut his positions in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) to buy more Palantir. Bruce Kamich of TheStreet recently hiked his price target to $48 per share. This helped the stock stay hot during the first quarter, rising by over one-third.
But since April began, it’s down 19%.
The Bear Claw
AI is one of those Internet buzzwords that make you swoon.
But isn’t Palantir getting a little ahead of itself, our Louis Navillier asks? Growth isn’t accelerating, nor is it expected to. It will certainly be profitable this year, and could be added to the S&P 500 at any time , forcing index funds to buy it.
But even if Palantir hits its top earnings estimate of 41 cents per share, you’re paying 49 times that to own it. That’s based on April 19’s closing price of $20.31.
The nosebleed valuation has some analysts downgrading the stock. Hype cycles, and AI is a hype cycle, are fragile things. Technologies always disappoint before they show their value.
Palantir’s Key Ally
While Palantir drew early interest by working with Cloud Czars like Microsoft, its alliance with Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL ) may be more important.
The two companies are sympatico on a deep level. Oracle was late to the cloud because it remains highly proprietary. Palantir is also highly proprietary.
But getting in late beats not getting in at all. Over the last 2 years Oracle stock is up 50% on the strength of its cloud. Its market cap is up to $315 billion. The deal also puts a floor under Palantir stock. If it falls, Oracle could buy it.
The Bottom Line
The wars in Ukraine and Gaza are very, very good news for Palantir. So is the rise of China. It’s prepared to exploit that through former Congressman Mike Gallagher, one of its new hires.
War is unhealthy for economies and other living things. It’s also very good for military contractors, especially those on the cutting edge like Palantir.
But getting Palantir stock to $48/share, or even $30, depends a lot more on its commercial arm than its military wing.
I wouldn’t rush to buy Palantir here. The recent wobble in AI semiconductor stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) may spread. But keep it in mind the next time animal spirits are feeding your view of the market. The long-term view of the business is positive.

2024-04-23,3 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy at a 52-Week Low in April,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
A lot of well-known blue-chip stocks that previously dominated their respective industries are struggling this year. One need only look at the year-to-date performance of the benchmark S&P 500 index to see many notable names deep in the red so far in 2024. Companies such as Nike (NYSE: NKE ), Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), just to name a few, continue to slide lower. The situation has only gotten worse as the entire market declines to start the year’s second quarter.
While concerning, and no doubt frustrating for existing shareholders, the continued drawdown presents an opportunity for investors to take new positions in some great stocks at or near their 52-week lows . Many of these top-shelf companies can be counted on to eventually rebound once their earnings strengthen, the operating environment improves, and market sentiment turns optimistic. In the meantime, investors have an opportunity to buy low in hopes of eventually selling high.
Here are three blue-chip stocks to buy at a 52-week low in April.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com
It seems strange to say, but Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is now trading right around its 52-week low, having declined nearly 15% on the year. AAPL stock is also negative over the last 12 months (down 0.01%), meaning it has erased all of its gains from the 2023 bull market. In what might be a bad omen for the company’s upcoming earnings report on May 2, media reports tell us that CEO Tim Cook and other senior executives have sold more than $70 million of company stock in April as the share price has steadily fallen.
CEO Cook has sold $33.3 million of Apple stock so far in April at an average price of $169.33 per share. Cook sold AAPL stock 12% below its peak of $192.53 reached in December 2023. At the same time, Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri, and Deirdre O’Brien, Senior Vice-President of Retail, also sold millions of dollars of Apple stock . This as International Data Corp. (IDC) reports that Apple’s iPhones shipments in the first quarter fell 9.6% from a year ago.
Also weighing on AAPL stock is the Department of Justice’s antitrust case against the technology giant, alleging that it violated federal law to preserve its position in the smartphone market. While there’s currently a buying opportunity with Apple’s stock, it might get even better after the company’s Q1 print in a few weeks.
Boeing Co. (BA)
Source: vaalaa / Shutterstock
For investors with a long time horizon, there is embattled airplane manufacturer Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA ). Having fallen 35% since January, BA stock is not only at a 52-week low, but is currently the third worst performing company in the S&P 500 index this year. Only Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Globe Life (NYSE: GL ), which has been accused of fraud , have performed worse than Boeing. However, while down, Boeing is likely to be far from out-given that it is one of only two major commercial aircraft manufacturers in the world.
Still, the pain for Boeing shareholders is likely to get worse before it gets better. The latest bad news is that airplane deliveries plunged in Q1 to their lowest level since the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021. Boeing has faced increased safety reviews by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) after a door plug blew off one of its 737 Max 9 airplanes in January. Consequently, Boeing delivered 83 new airplanes to customers in Q1, down 47% from 157 deliveries in the previous quarter.
As with Apple, Boeing’s stock could drop further after the company reports its Q1 financial results on April 24. But for long-term investors, the current share price decline could be a solid buying opportunity.
Spirit Airlines (SAVE)
Source: Markus Mainka / Shutterstock.com
Another aviation stock that is right near its 52-week low and struggling right now is Spirit Airlines (NYSE: SAVE ). Down 75% on the year, SAVE stock is now trading under $5 a share, putting it in penny stock territory. The steep selloff comes after JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ: JBLU ) pulled out of a deal to purchase the discount carrier for $3.8 billion, and amid a Pratt & Whitney engine recall. Spirit Airlines announced that it is deferring new aircraft purchases and laying off 260 pilots as it struggles with a liquidity problem.
While not without risk, SAVE stock could be worth a gamble now that its stock has fallen so much and is trading near rock bottom prices. The company appears to be doing all it can to conserve cash and improve its liquidity. Specifically, Spirit Airlines is deferring all aircraft orders, pushing them out as far as 2031. The budget airline is also furloughing the pilots. The combined moves will boost its liquidity by about $340 million over the next two years. And who knows, in that time another buyer may emerge for Spirit Airlines.

Introduction
Amidst rising geopolitical risk and an ongoing surge in long-duration treasury yields (propelled by resurgent inflation), broad US equity markets took a tumble last week, with the S&P-500 ( SPY ) dipping ~4% and the tech-heavy QQQ ETF ( QQQ ) falling ~6%.

2024-04-22,7 Deadly Dividend Stocks to Avoid at All Costs: April 2024,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
While dividend stocks can be a good option for investors looking for an available revenue stream, not every dividend stock is worth your time. Plenty of deadly dividend stocks are ready to wreak havoc on your portfolio.
The worst thing about a deadly dividend stock is the inconsistency. You want to have a reliable payout schedule so you can plan your finances accordingly. You also want a dividend stock with a history of maintaining or growing its payout.
Unfortunately, one of the first things a struggling company will do is cut the dividend, especially if it needs the cash to pay off debt or if profits are taking a beating.
Investors who rely on dividends as a source of income may find it challenging to budget or plan for the future when dividend payments are suddenly cut.
We’re using the Portfolio Grader to help weed out the deadly dividend stocks you should avoid in April 2024.
Evaluate stocks based on earnings, growth, dividends, momentum, and analyst sentiment for success in Q2.
You can avoid the deadly dividend stocks that will sink your returns.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is actually more than a smartphone manufacturer. It makes and sells personal computers, wearable technology, tablets and more.
Its powerful Services segment includes the App Store where Apple allows developers to market their apps to the public. Apple gets a piece of that action, making it one of the company’s most profitable ventures.
Then there’s the downside. Apple’s seen iPhone sales slip, particularly in China where sales in the first six weeks of the year were down 24%. Sales of other products are also down, but not nearly as much as the iPhone in China.
That means Apple needs to find a way to compete with China’s homegrown smartphone maker, Huawei, or find a way to replace that revenue.
It does all that as both U.S. and U.K. regulators are looking into the App Store for possibly illegally blocking the competition.
Apple stock offers a dividend yield of just 0.5%, which isn’t nearly enough to cover its 13% loss in 2024. It gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.
Microchip Technology (MCHP)
Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com
Microchip Technology (NASDAQ: MCHP ) is an Arizona company that makes microcontroller, mixed-signal, analog and Flash-IP products. Its customers are in the industrial, automotive, consumer, communications, computing and aerospace markets.
The company’s integrated circuits have been on the market for more than 20 years and are included in more than 100,000 products. Microchips are found in everyday products such as calculators, bank ATM, car infotainment systems and cell phones.
While the company makes important products, the stock has been maddingly inconsistent, with numerous price swings over the last 12 months.
The stock is down 6% since Jan. 1 on the heels of reporting weak earnings in the last quarter (Q3 of fiscal 2024, ending Dec. 31, 2023).
Revenue was $1.76 billion , a drop of 18.6% from a year ago and short of the company’s guidance. Microchip blamed the issue on weaker business conditions and lowered demand.
CEO Ganesh Moorthy says the company will cut discretionary spending and manage inventory in the near term.
MCHP provides a dividend yield of 2%. It gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.
Realty Income (O)
Source: Shutterstock
Realty Income (NYSE: O ) is a sizable real estate investment trust with over 13,000 properties. Realty Income has interests in every U.S. state. That’s a huge footprint. Plus, it works with customers in 90 industries.
The biggest issue for Realty Income is debt. Borrowing money to purchase properties cost a lot more when interest rates are higher. That’s why even though Realty Income saw a significant increase in revenue in the fourth quarter, its income dropped.
One positive thing about Realty Income is the generous dividend yield of 6% that’s paid monthly. But I’m going to be skeptical of O stock until interest rates come back down to a more manageable level.
O stock is down 9% this year and gets an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader.
U.S. Bancorp (USB)
Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com
U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB ) isn’t the biggest bank in the country, but it’s pretty close.
It ranks as the No. 5 banking company in size in the United States, primarily serving the 26 states in the Midwest and Western U.S.
Many banks, including U.S. Bancorp, have been troubled by the interest rate issue. The company has been forced to offer higher interest rates on deposit accounts to customers to prevent them from shifting their money into high-yielding bonds.
That strategy weighs directly on the company’s bottom line, with first-quarter earnings showing that profits at U.S. Bancorp dropped 22% from a year ago.
It also lowered its guidance on net interest income, the money banks pay customers and what they earn on interest on loans.
USB previously guided for income net interest income of $16.6 billion for the full year, but now says it will be somewhere from a range between $16.1 billion and $16.4 billion.
USB stock pays a dividend yield of nearly 5%, but the stock is down more than 8% this year and gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.
Ford Motor Co. (F)
Source: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.com
Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F ) is a well-known member of the Big Three Detroit automakers. The stock pays a solid dividend yield of nearly 5%.
So what’s not to love? Plenty, as it turns out.
Ford has to compete with other automakers, particularly Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) which is singlehandedly driving down the price of electric vehicles. Tesla cut prices in 2023 and 2024 as it seeks to boost its sales numbers.
I don’t think it’s a great strategy because it eats into the profit margin – and investors hate it when a company’s profitability suffers. Now Ford is going through the same issue.
Ford cut the price of its Mustang Mach-E electric SUV by up to $8,100, and its cutting prices on its 2024 Ford F-150 Lighting, and all-electric pickup.
Next week the company is reporting first-quarter earnings and I want to see how the profit numbers hold up.
F stock is down 1% in 2024 and gets an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader.
Lowe’s Companies (LOW)
Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com
Lowe’s Companies (NYSE: LOW ) is primarily known for its giant brick-and-mortar home improvement stores.
It peddles everything that you need to build a house, complete a major construction project, plant a tree or simply decorate your patio.
The company has more than 1,700 home improvement or outlet stores in the U.S., covering every state and the District of Columbia. And while shares were soaring earlier this year, there’s trouble on the horizon and LOW stock is already feeling the heat.
In reporting its fourth-quarter and full year 2023 earnings in February, Lowe’s disclosed that it expects sales to drop by 2% to 3% in 2024. And profits will also take a hit, with earnings per share expected to fall by more than 7%.
That’s enough to send investors scurrying, and LOW stock is down 10% in the last six weeks alone.
LOW stock pays a dividend yield of 2% and gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.
General Mills (GIS)
Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
General Mills (NYSE: GIS ) is best known for its iconic breakfast foods from Cheerios ro Progresso soups and Green Giant vegetables.
All that sounds great. But sales are down as of late.
In the fiscal third quarter of 2024, General Mills reported sales down 1% to $5.1 billion.
That was a better outlook than the previous quarter, when the company was forced to lower its organic sales guidance from a previous range of 3% to 4% to just 1%.
That’s why you should treat General Mills with caution, even though the stock is up 6% on the year and its pays a decent dividend yield of 3.4%.
All in all, there are worse stocks than General Mills. But there are much better dividend stocks you can buy as well, so avoid this “D” rated stock.

At a 3.53% yield, SCHD has a higher yield than most single shares of blue chip names available, including the energy sector, which is one of the cheapest in the market.
Time for a shave
It has come the time to count one's blessings. Those who have bought and held shares of a lot of demolished blue chip stocks since the fortuitous bottoms in 2020 and 2022 have a lot to be thankful for. Yes, it takes some skill to identify single shares that are both ""cheap"" and have the prospects of snapping back to their all-time highs with even some extra growth baked into boot. While I preach buy and hold and have almost no turnover per year in my portfolio [I aim for less than 5%], there comes a time when reducing winners does not equate to ""picking the flowers and watering the weeds"" as Peter Lynch would say.
As I sit on a few of these winners, I have been sorting through and making a few reductions, stuffing the winnings into various index funds. Namely State Street and Vanguard's S&P 500 index funds ( SPLG ) ( VOO ), Invesco's Q's fund ( QQQ ), and of course, Schwab's U.S. Dividend Equity ETF ( SCHD ). Of the lot, SCHD is the cheapest index with a P/E ratio of only 14.5 X:

2024-04-21,Technology Hitting The Peak Of The 2024 Market Cycle With Rotation To Value,"The article provides an update on the market outlook for 2024 using the latest Momentum Gauge® signals.
It discusses the rotation from technology stocks to value stocks and the impact on the market.
The article highlights the importance of following money flows and finding the best valuations to avoid major market downturns.
The odds of a Fed rate cut in June have dropped to 16.6% down from near certainty of 100% in January and ""higher for longer"" is beginning to show cracks in the market.
Money flows are showing increased volatility and movement toward safety and value stocks as investors begin to take profits from technology.
Introduction
This article updates my outlook for 2024 with the latest Momentum Gauge® signals and a revisit of the January Investing Experts Podcast interview with Rena Sherbill at Seeking Alpha.

2024-04-21,High-Quality Dividend Growth Near 52-Week Lows: Apple Is Attractive,"A list of high-quality dividend growth stocks trading near 52-week lows is evaluated based on Historical and Future Fair values.
Apple appears to be near fair value, and trading near 52-week lows could be at a favorable entry point for long-term investment.
The current risks facing Apple appear to be well managed, and the fundamental business is well positioned for continued growth.
Bristol Myers Squibb and Cisco also appear to be attractive investment opportunities based on their historical and future fair values, as well as analyst estimates.
Introduction and Background
The market, as a whole, continues to appear to be overvalued, and it has been hard to find good opportunities to put my capital to work at valuations that I am comfortable with. I am not necessarily a deep value investor, but I also don't like to feel like I am drastically over-paying. Even though it has been more challenging, I have been finding some stocks that appear attractive. Maintaining a watch list of around 100 high-quality dividend growth stocks that I regularly value helps to identify opportunities when they do arise.
On top of regularly calculating fair values for my watchlist, one of my favorite ways to look for value in this high-quality dividend growth space is to screen for those stocks trading near 52-week lows. I decided to filter my watchlist by companies that are trading at less than 30% of their 52-week range (52-week low being 0% and 52-week high being 100%)....",29
2024-04-21,A Brand-New Quant Crypto Tool Is Your Key to Financial Freedom,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Editor’s note: This article was previously published in September 2023 . It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.
What I’m about to say, I don’t say lightly.
Over the next 5 minutes, you’re going to learn something that will change the way you look at markets forever – and help you get on the right path toward true financial freedom in this new world of artificial intelligence (AI) .
I know that sounds like quite an exaggeration, but it is true.
After reading this “something,” you’ll probably look back on so many of your investments that went wrong and just shake your head…
“Oh, I get it now!”
This is the general idea: Every stock, crypto, bond or commodity follows the same predictable pattern. That pattern occurs in four stages. In some of those stages, prices rise. In other stages, they fall. The key to making money in any asset, in any market, at any time, is to buy and sell only at the right stages.
It is a simple secret to generating wealth on Wall Street. Yet, it is a well-guarded secret that very few people know about.
Which is why if you learn about this hidden pattern today, you could be equipped with an almost unfair advantage over every other investor.
So… let’s go ahead and learn about this hidden pattern and the secret stages that all stocks follow.
Stage 1: Consolidation
As exciting as it can be to watch top-performing stock and cryptos ring up gains, they actually spend a lot of time moving sideways.
During these periods – called consolidation stages – not much happens in the stock.
A consolidation stage is characterized by sideways movement in the stock price, as seen in the chart of Apple ( AAPL ) below. The highlighted area is a consolidation stage.
The lack of a stock’s forward movement during this stage can be caused by a variety of things…
The broad market may be struggling.
Maybe the company missed a lofty quarterly earnings target set by Wall Street analysts.
It might be that the stock is “digesting” gains produced during a big price run.
Whatever the reason, the asset makes no headway during a consolidation stage. There’s no upward momentum.
If you’re looking to trade stocks or cryptos for short-term gains, you should avoid buying when they’re locked in a consolidation stage. Instead, you should wait for them to enter Stage 2.
Stage 2: Breakout
A consolidation stage can last for months or years. But eventually, every great top-performing business generates such fantastic revenue and/or earnings growth that the world takes notice.
Large money managers learn about the company, its growth, and its huge future potential.
And they begin buying shares… often by the millions.
The same goes for cryptos. A great project has some major breakthrough. Investors take notice, and they pile into the token.
All this buying generates what we call an “ upside breakout . ”
This is when an asset reaches a new high price. The price literally “breaks out” of its sideways pattern. You can see how Apple broke out of its consolidation stage in the chart below.
Stage-2 advancements are almost always characterized by a surge in trading volume. This is because more and more investors learn about the company, and they buy shares.
The increased buying power sends the stock even higher. This makes more people notice the stock or crypto to buy, which sends the price even higher… which makes more people notice… and so on.
The asset enters a self-reinforcing “ rally cycle . ”
Buying begets more buying.
It’s a beautiful thing.
A Stage-2 rally can be kicked off by a variety of things – an incredible quarterly earnings report, news of a product breakthrough, excellent clinical trials results, or a positive report from an influential investor.
And this kind of rally can last for months, even a few years.
It’s not uncommon for top growth stocks to double or triple in value in less than a year during Stage-2 advancements.
Occasionally, stocks climb four, five, six, even 10-fold . Top cryptos can even soar 10X in less than a year during Stage-2 breakouts.
Let’s return to the Apple example we’ve been working with. That stock soared 83% in less than two years.
Stage 3: Distribution
Now, no party lasts forever.
Eventually, every super-performing stock or run-away crypto experiences a correction… a period of declining prices.
And as with other stages, this can be caused by a variety of things…
A decline in the broad market…
A serious but solvable problem at the company…
Or maybe investors just bid the company’s shares to very high valuations, and the stock needs to “take a breather” and return to more rational levels.
But before a correction takes hold, stocks and cryptos typically experience what’s called a distribution stage.
This is a period when investors and traders who bought shares before the rally sell their positions and take profits.
They sell to less-informed investors who are arriving late to the party.
You can see Apple’s distribution stage below.
During this Stage 3, the asset is no longer soaring.
It typically trades in a sideways-to-lower pattern. This reflects the push and pull of investors who are sitting on big profits and selling to new investors who, again, are late to the party.
The Stage-2 buying frenzy marked a generally steady rise in prices. But the Stage 3 distribution period is characterized by a trading channel.
And then, the stock or crypto enters a correction.
Stage 4: Correction
This is the least-enjoyable part of a top-performing asset’s life cycle.
This stage is sort of like the hangover after a party.
As I mentioned earlier, no asset – no matter how great – goes up every day, every week, every year.
The market tends to go wild for elite stocks and cryptos and bids them up to unsustainable levels.
Investors will bid to levels that the fundamentals don’t currently justify.
Stage-4 corrections act to “wash away” the excesses and set realistic expectations.
Here’s Apple’s correction in late 2018.
Stage-4 corrections can come in different shapes and sizes. Assets can correct 20%, 30%, 40%, even 60% from their highs. And these corrections can last months or even years.
After Stage 4, top growth stocks and cryptos return to Stage 1, the consolidation stage.
They “lick their wounds” and spend some time trading sideways.
During this consolidation, they continue to register increasing revenues and/or earnings. They build up power for their next leg higher.
Thanks to their growing businesses and now-lower share prices, they often sport attractive valuations… which allows us to make money in the next Stage 2 .
Apple’s Long-Term Growth
The chart below shows the stock price of Apple from 2001 to early 2020.
As you can see, Apple regularly cycled through periods of consolidation, advancement, distribution, and correction during its extraordinary run . And they produced returns of about 30,000%.
I’m a major proponent of long-term investing.
For people who don’t have the interest or time to follow the stock market every day or every week, it’s a great way to grow wealth.
As we’ve seen with Apple, you can make outstanding returns by holding a good stock through all its stages.
But if you’re interested in riding top assets for short- to medium-term profits while avoiding what can be substantial, painful drawdowns, the lesson is clear…
Restrict your buying only to stocks entering Stage 2 !
The Final Word on Our Next-Gen AI Trading System
Like many of you, we have always been fascinated by the potential of data analytics in the investing sphere. The emergence of ChatGPT really put the power of AI in perspective for the rest of the world. But we have long sought to harness the power of artificial intelligence to outperform the markets. That’s why our team of Caltech quants set out on a journey to make investing with AI a reality.
Over the past few years, my team has developed a groundbreaking AI-powered trading system that applies quantitative stage analysis to every stock in the market. And we’ve scored some huge wins with this powerful tool.
And to prepare for the Fourth Bitcoin Halving, we’ve tailored this system toward the crypto markets so we can identify the projects with the most explosive short-term upside potential.
After all, history shows that the 12 months after a halving event are arguably the best opportunity investors have to make 10X returns in just a few months.
And we’re at that point right now.
The crypto markets are likely positioned to soar unimaginably over the next 12 months. Dozens of altcoins could soar 1,000%-plus in a hurry.
If you’re interested in catching a ride on a few 10X cryptos, join in next Tuesday morning, April 23, at 10 a.m. Eastern, for our new quant system’s grand debut.
Reserve your seat right now.

2024-04-21,Why Warren Buffett Has 68% of Berkshire Hathaway's $361 Billion Portfolio Invested in Only 4 Stocks,"Many financial advisors strongly recommend investors diversify their portfolios. They subscribe to Sir John Templeton's principle, ""Diversification is a safety factor that is essential because we should be humble enough to admit we can be wrong.""
But Warren Buffett seemingly isn't a big fan of diversification. Buffett has nearly 68% of Berkshire Hathaway 's $361 billion portfolio invested in only four stocks. Why?
Berkshire owns more than 905 million shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) worth over $152 billion. This one stock makes up a whopping 42% of Berkshire's portfolio. The percentage was even higher last year before Buffett (or one of his two investment managers) trimmed Berkshire's position in Apple a little in the fourth quarter of 2023 .",29
2024-04-20,Better Dividend Stock Buy: Apple vs. Coca-Cola,"They don't compete in the same industry, but Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) share many similarities as investment candidates. The companies own two of the most valuable brands on the planet, helping them command huge profit margin advantages over their peers. And they are cash-generating machines, which gives their management teams extra resources they can direct toward stock buybacks and a growing dividend payment.
Coca-Cola and Apple are both favorites of billionaire investor Warren Buffett, too.
With those similarities in mind, let's stack the two companies up against each other as dividend investments.",29
2024-04-20,Apple Generated $23 Billion of Q1 2024 Revenue From Something Other Than Hardware Devices.

It has gotten to this point by selling some of the most popular consumer electronics products in the world. This success has resulted in huge gains for shareholders over the years.
To be clear, this is still an enterprise built on hardware sales. In the latest fiscal quarter (Q1 2024 ended Dec. 30, 2023), devices generated $96 billion in revenue, accounting for 81% of the total.
But Apple produced $23 billion in sales from something else entirely during the three-month period. Is this budding segment enough of a reason to consider buying this top Warren Buffett stock ?",29

Apple ( AAPL ) is one of an elite group of companies with a market capitalization above $2 trillion . When I last wrote about the company a year ago, the valuation was $2.7 trillion, slightly higher than the current level.

2024-04-19,Apple's Vision Pro Stumbles: Time to Dump These 3 VR Stocks?,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) may be losing momentum among VR stocks, even as tech advancements continue elevating the burgeoning sector into public consciousness. More than half of teens who own the Apple Vision Pro or similar devices rarely use them , which is a death knell for companies like Apple trying to target the next generation of tech consumers. To that end, Apple is strategically pivoting to market the Vision Pro as an ideal business/remote work tool. Priced at $3,500 and on the heels of Zuckerberg’s attempt to do the same, I’m not optimistic.
Unfortunately, Apple may be heading for a lost decade (or worse) as it continually fails to innovate tech that excites consumers. Apple’s top sellers are simply iterations of existing products, and their new initiatives (beyond just the Vision Pro) tend to disappoint or die on the vine — Apple Car, anyone?
Understandably, Vision Pro’s struggle is spooking investors bullish on VR stocks’ long-term potential. But don’t throw out the baby with the bathwater. Some decent VR stocks are still on the market, even if Apple is a stinker.
Unity Software (U)
Source: viewimage / Shutterstock.com
Down 40% this year amid wider gaming sector struggles, Unity Software (NYSE: U ) will likely suffer alongside Apple – but don’t sell this stock yet (even if it isn’t worth buying quite yet).
One of Cathie Wood’s top VR stock picks, her investment thesis is compelling. She recently dropped another few million into Unity, seeing it as a company at the forefront of the metaverse, gaming and VR sectors. Unity’s unmatched potential at the intersection of these key areas positions it as a premier VR choice for enhancing a digital tech portfolio. Still, this comes on the heels of multiple layoff rounds as Unity seeks to right-size itself in today’s economic climate — hence my feeling that the stock isn’t quite a Buy today.
Unity’s unique value propositions are diverse and were highlighted in a White Brook Capital report . The analysts praised Unity’s “digital twin platform” for its distinct ability to replicate real-world objects, materials and people within a VR/metaverse context. Unlike many early-stage VR stocks, Unity generates positive cash flow through a robust advertising network. This profitability boosts Unity’s resilience against broader market uncertainties until VR stocks attract more widespread institutional interest.
Qualcomm (QCOM)

Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) may be a major Apple partner, but the VR stock is sufficiently diversified that Apple’s ongoing woes shouldn’t have a major impact on per-share pricing. At the same time, its wider prospects make it an attractive buy, particularly at these levels.
Beyond Apple, its joint venture with Samsung and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) strengthens its hardware dominance and signals a promising future as VR markets continue to evolve.
The collaboration aims to create a comprehensive mixed-reality platform, leveraging Qualcomm’s technological expertise, Samsung’s hardware capabilities and Google’s investments in virtual reality tools. While the market awaits a definitive product announcement, industry analysts expect the partnership to produce a series of headsets that provide novel virtual reality experiences, potentially significantly increasing Qualcomm’s revenue.
Furthermore, Qualcomm is consistently enhancing its extensive array of virtual reality products, including headsets. These products, powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processor , incorporate the latest WiFi technology and eye-tracking capabilities, pushing the boundaries of innovation in the VR space and establishing new industry standards.
Matterport (MTTR)
Source: II.studio / Shutterstock.com
Matterport (NASDAQ: MTTR ) has been on a losing streak. Its stock has dropped 30% since January, setting it up to lose the fight within the wider VR stocks landscape.
Analysts are increasingly bearish on the stock, with the vast majority agreeing that the VR stock will underperform in 2024. Though recent initiatives, including a strategic partnership with franchising gym chain Crunch Fitness , might be a move in the right direction, Matterport has a deep hole to dig itself out of.
Matterport has faced challenges adapting to changing economic conditions that previously drove its stock up. In response, the company laid off 30% of its workforce as a cost-cutting measure. CEO RJ Pittman explained that the layoffs and other measures are intended to “sharpen our strategic focus and accelerate our path to profitability.” Pittman set forth this plan in 2023’s second quarter; thus far, his vision hasn’t been borne out for the VR stock.

2024-04-19,Apple Stock: There Are Too Many Worms With Today's AAPL,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
In recent months, investors have become more hesitant to take a bite out of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and add it to their portfolios. That’s not surprising. Macro worries may be weighing on all of the “Mag 7” stocks, but in the case of Apple stock, blame it more on company-specific issues.
Namely, continued weak demand for iPhones, especially in China. Increased regulatory scrutiny has also affected the stock’s performance. At the onset of AAPL’s steady slide in price, factors like excitement about the company’s AI prospects may have helped to mitigate declines.
However, with the market taking a breather with its excitement about the generative AI growth trend right now, there’s little out there preventing this stock from getting out of its present slump.
Why Apple Stock is Not So Magnificent Right Now
Admittedly, Apple has not been the worst-performing “Magnificent Seven” stock this year. That “honor” goes to Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ). However, being “second-worst” is nowhere near being one of the best. It’s merely the second stock making up what one could call “the not-so-magnificent two.”
There have been substantive reasons behind the market’s bearish-leaning view on Apple stock. As discussed above, iPhone demand remains weak, and that’s putting it nicely. Per market researcher IDC, iPhone sales fell by 9.6% year-over-year last quarter. The key reason for this has been big declines in Chinese iPhone sales.
Apple is struggling to compete with China-based smartphone makers like Huawei . In response to the latest disheartening iPhone sales news, analysts have made downward revisions to forecasts. For instance, Needham’s Laura Martin has lowered both her estimates for the preceding quarter , as well as for the current and upcoming fiscal years.
Maxim Group’s Tom Forte currently rates AAPL a “hold,” but has many concerns about the company’s near-term prospects . Per Forte, China-related headwinds will continue. Overall iPhone sales will move even lower, and there’s great uncertainty about AI slow-mover Apple soon making a big breakthrough in that fast-growing area of the tech sector.
Downside Risk More Substantial Than You Think
The market may lean bearish, but optimism about Apple stock hasn’t fully gone away. A good example is with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. Ives believes that any major update about Apple’s gen AI plans could move the needle for AAPL.
However, with enthusiasm cooling for even the AI early-movers among major tech stocks , Ives may be overly optimistic about how much Apple’s “AI catch-up” will have on price performance. Worse yet, coupled with this questionable near-term upside potential, is the fact that downside risk with Apple may be fairly substantial.
Here’s what I mean. Currently, AAPL is trading at around 25.8 times forward earnings. Yes, many “Mag 7” stocks trade at a premium compared to Apple, but this valuation arguably incorporates the potential for the company to swiftly recover from its current slump as a high probability.
If weak results continue, the market could call this valuation into question.
That’s not all. Don’t forget the aforementioned regulatory headwinds. These are coming both from the U.S., as well as the European Union. As Morningstar’s William Kerwin recently argued, investors have reacted negatively to headlines related to this factor . Presumably, subsequent headlines will elicit a further negative reaction.
Skip AAPL, Stick to More Promising Tech Plays
So, how far do we think AAPL could fall from here before the dust settles? It’s doubtful that Apple will tumble to a value stock multiple soon, but a slide down towards a forward valuation in the low-20s is well-within the realm of possibility.
Why? That’s what some previously-underperforming “Mag 7” stocks were trading for, before their 2023 rebounds. At 20 times forward earnings, Apple would trade for around $131.20 per share. In other words, around 22% below current price levels.
Until this happens, or until the many “worms” afflicting Apple stock begin to fade, it may be best to skip on it, and go with the more promising big tech contenders out there.
Apple stock earns a D rating in Portfolio Grader .

2024-04-19,1 Warren Buffett ETF to Buy and Hold Forever,"Billionaire Warren Buffett is famous for his skill at picking individual stocks. His returns have been phenomenal, trouncing the wider market averages over the past several decades.
But choosing individual stocks like his favorites (such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) ) is not what Buffett recommends for most investors. Rather, the Oracle of Omaha believes you'd be much better off putting your money in a low-cost fund that seeks to replicate the returns from an index like the S&P 500 . That way, your gains will beat the vast majority of professionals on Wall Street, with very little effort on your part.

2024-04-19,Inflation-Proof Your Portfolio: 3 Overvalued Stocks to Dump Now,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Sometimes, the trading price of a stock may seem too good to be true. That’s often because it is. Company valuations are a tricky business , they are often tied to a complex combination of financial performance and public perception. This can result in some companies listing as being worth more than their true intrinsic value on the stock market.
In times of inflation, the ultimate method of retaining wealth is holding appreciating assets instead of cash. As the value of cash depreciates, and buying power lessens, holding stocks that are overvalued could hurt long-term portfolio growth, as price corrections are inevitable.
Furthermore, the market continues to look more and more like the bears are coming out , investors may want to consider which stocks are promising more than they can deliver. Thus, here are three of the most overvalued stocks to sell, should the market take a turn for the worse.
Tesla (TSLA)
Source: kovop / Shutterstock.com
As the revolutionary leader in electric vehicle technology, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) has consistently struggled with overvaluation. For many years, the company has consistently delivered on expectations, despite offering a product with questionable demand . That’s because, even though the electric car sounds like a life-changing technology, most people simply cannot afford a Tesla.
Thus, the company offers a premium solution in search of a marginal problem. As global economic factors like inflation and supply chain scarcity have squeezed consumers, many have begun questioning the real value of owning an electric car. Moreover, questions regarding range reliability in cold weather and overall travel practicality have begun eroding demand, thus slowing Tesla sales .
Pair this with recent restructuring efforts by Elon Musk, which led to a 10% workforce reduction , and the writing may be on the wall for Tesla. Though the company is certainly not going anywhere, investors who entered overvalued positions on the stock may want to consider a sale until the price corrects some more.
Dell Technologies (DELL)
Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com
When was the last time Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL ) delivered an exceptional product? The company dominates neither the gaming sector or the creative sector, and its enterprise laptops are lackluster. Competitors from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) to ASUS (TPE:2357) have consistently provided better, more complete machines than Dell.
Why is it, then, that the company’s stock price has soared nearly 170% in the last year ? A major contributing factor has been the company’s savvy partnerships with AI companies to provide server solutions. This, however, could genuinely be a product of hype , as the firm’s bottom line may not see the long-term growth in server sales necessary to maintain such an inflated share price.
Moreover, the company’s AI servers essentially offer packaged, inflexible iterations of NVIDIA’s (NASDAQ: NVDA ) data center Graphics Processing Units. Considering the cost of these GPUs, it’s likely that Dell’s margins are much thinner than the sales numbers might lead us to believe.
Southwest Airlines (LUV)
Source: Carlos E. Santa Maria / Shutterstock.com
Tech companies aren’t the only stocks at risk of overvaluation. Take, for example, airline companies like Southwest Airlines , (NYSE: LUV ) which occupies an awkward operational niche. Somewhere between a major international airline and a domestic regional one, Southwest Airlines’ cost of revenue holds back its earning potential . The reason, however, has little to do with customers, and everything to do with aircraft choices.
Due to its size and niche as a domestic airline, Southwest chose to operate Boeing 737s as its sole aircraft type . Considering the present scandals surrounding the aircraft, Southwest likely has some issues in its future. Furthermore, the airline focuses almost exclusively on profitable routes within the U.S. borders.
While this helps mitigate revenue costs, it limits the airline’s growth and exposure to new customers. The combination of these two factors could make Southwest one of the overvalued stocks to sell, should market conditions worsen.

2024-04-19,3 Stocks With the Most Potential to Plunge on Q1 Earnings,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Earnings season is a high-stakes time . Fortunes can be won or lost depending on whether a company beats or misses Wall Street expectations. For some companies, the stakes are particularly high. Analysts and investors have put some companies on notice after recent earnings flops that a turnaround is needed. Many high-profile concerns have struggled this year amid declining demand and sales, effectively making them “show me” stocks.
While it’s still early days, earnings season has already proven to be a mixed bag . With the big banks reporting results first, some like Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ) saw their stocks jump on better-than-expected results, while other such as JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM ) sank as their guidance disappointed. With the earnings train shifting into high gear and several marquee companies scheduled to report in the coming weeks, we look at three stocks with the most potential to plunge on Q1 results.
Tesla (TSLA)
Source: kovop / Shutterstock.com
Expectations are that Tesla’s (NASDAQ: TSLA ) print on April 23 will be bad. The only question appears to be: how bad? The company has been telegraphing for months that demand and sales are weakening. First-quarter vehicle delivery numbers released on April 2 (the closest approximation to sales) were 386,810, a decline of 8.5% from a year earlier. More recent news that Tesla is cutting 10% of its global workforce and has paused manufacturing of its Cybertruck due to technical problems also hasn’t inspired confidence.
Tesla’s stock is already in the doldrums. Down 37% on the year, TSLA stock is the second worst performer in the benchmark S&P 500 index. The company’s market capitalization has dropped below $500 billion as the share price sinks. Tesla has now erased $290 billion in shareholder wealth this year, and that loss could get worse with the upcoming Q1 results. Management says they are pivoting to focus on self-driving vehicles, with plans to unveil the long-promised “Robotaxi” in August. Wall Street remains skeptical.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com
Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock has been struggling since the company’s last earnings report was delivered in early February. Year to date, AAPL stock has been down nearly 10% and is badly trailing the market. The company has also lost its crown as the biggest publicly traded company in the world to rival Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). The main concern heading into the Q1 print is declining sales of Apple’s hardware devices, particularly the iPhone. Preliminary results are not encouraging.
Recent data from International Data Corp. claims that iPhone shipments declined nearly 10% globally in this year’s first quarter due to rising competition in China. According to IDC, Apple shipped 50.1 million iPhones from January through March, down 9.6% from 55.4 million shipments a year earlier. Rival Samsung has also taken over the top sales spot from Apple with a 20.8% market share and having shipped 60.1 million devices in Q1. Apple’s share of the global smartphone market has fallen to 17.3% from 20.7% a year ago.
Apple reports earnings on May 2.
Nvidia (NVDA)
Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com
The question facing Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) heading into its May 22 Q1 financial results is: how long can the company continue to grow at a blistering pace and beat extremely difficult comparables and forecasts? After all, this is a company whose Q4 2023 sales rose 265% from a year earlier while its profits grew 769% year over year. Eventually things have to slow down , right? The consensus among analysts is that Nvidia will have a hard time jumping the high earnings bar it has set for itself in Q1.
Should Nvidia’s Q1 print miss the mark, it will no doubt be bad for the company’s stock and the overall market. In the lead-up to recent earnings reports , the stock market has wavered and then rallied when Nvidia beat expectations. The reverse could easily happen if Nvidia’s Q1 numbers disappoint. NVDA stock has continued to be a high-flier this year, gaining 77% and notching the second-best performance among securities listed on the S&P 500. Whatever the results, investors should prepare for the market to move.

2024-04-19,Wall Street Favorites: 3 Meme Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for April 2024,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Not too long ago, GameStop (NYSE: GME ) and other meme stocks took the stock market by storm, leveraging the power of Reddit’s (NYSE: RDDT ) communities. This movement took beaten-down stocks (for mostly good reason) to the moon, highlighting the massive influence of retail investors. Though the initial frenzy has subsided greatly, the spirit of investing in strong buy meme stock continues to live on.
However, the article does not focus on meme stocks in the conventional sense. Meme stocks are typically known for their shaky fundamentals and lackluster prospects; instead, I’m focusing on just the opposite. However, like traditional meme stocks, these three boast a strong online presence. I’ve used Apewisdom.io to identify these strong buy meme stocks that truly have staying power.
Strong Buy Meme Stocks To Buy: Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)
Source: ToyW / Shutterstock
Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM ) is a true juggernaut in semiconductor manufacturing. It is involved in the production of 90% of the world’s advanced chips. With its cutting-edge chip manufacturing prowess, it continues to be a needle-mover in the tech space, essentially becoming a backbone for top tech firms, including Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ). It now finds itself in a position to capitalize on the surging demand for AI capabilities, projecting a heartening 23% bump in its top-line growth this year. With 2023 revenues closing at $68.6 billion, this would translate into a whopping $84.4 billion this year.
With the tech landscape increasingly reliant on advanced chips, TSMC remains one of the best ways to play the trend. Moreover, in the past six months alone, it has gained 55%, having gained 61% in value last year. Looking ahead, analysts are optimistic about TSM stock’s prospects, forecasting a healthy 14% upside potential from current prices.
AMD (AMD)
Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
AMD has been making significant breakthroughs as a challenger to Nvidia’s dominance in the AI chip space. Particularly with its powerful MI300X microchip, the company has positioned itself to efficiently capitalize on high-demand sectors such as servers and data centers. Moreover, these M1300 chips are competitively priced significantly below Nvidia’s H100 chips while outperforming the latter across many applications.
Nevertheless, it is tough to gauge whether AMD could dent Nvidia’s sales at this time, but initial comparisons are optimistic. Bolstering AMD’s prospects, analyst HSBC analyst Frank Lee upgraded AMD stock to ‘buy’ from ‘hold,’ raising the price target from $180 to $225. Lee expects solid performance forecasts for 2024 and 2025, especially in non-AI segments. Additionally, his opinion is due to AMD’s innovative prowess and attractive portfolio, which makes it a top pick in the AI chip space.
Moreover, AMD stock has witnessed strong momentum over the past few months, with a 6-month return exceeding 54% . Also, Wall-Street expects the stock to continue climbing, with more than a 20% upside from current price levels.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com
Most Magnificent 7 stocks are ticking in the green this year, but Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) finds itself in an unusual position. AAPL stock is down by almost double-digits due to multiple headwinds including slowing demand, particularly in China, and an ongoing antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. However, the temporary downturn presents an excellent ‘buy-the-dip’ opportunity, especially with the tech giant slated to announce generative AI innovations at the upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference in June .
Though the company’s entry into the burgeoning AI realm is still modest, its potential is massive. According to its CEO, Tim Cook, the company has made significant investments in AI and will make major announcements in the upcoming months. Furthermore, considering Apple’s powerful in-house design capabilities, including partnerships with chip giants in TSMC, the firm will likely see substantial upside ahead. Hence, despite the regulatory hurdles, Apple’s strong financial base and strategic direction offer a solid foundation for success.

2024-04-19,Only Have $100? 3 No-Brainer Stocks to Buy in April 2024,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
It used to be you had to have money to make money on Wall Street. And few people actually owned stocks. According to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Financial Characteristics of Consumers , fewer than two families in 10 owned stocks as recently as 1962. However, 60 years later the same survey found as many as 58% of all families owned stocks.
There has been a great democratization of investing over those six decades. From the advent of the first discount broker Charles Schwab (NYSE: SCHW ) to deep discount traders like E-Trade and TD Ameritrade, the cost of making an investment has been going down. And Robinhood (NASDAQ: HOOD ) forced the industry to virtually give up transaction fees. Now you can buy and sell stocks at no cost!
Essentially all the barriers previously erected to keep investing as the playground of the rich have been torn down. That means you can find stocks to buy with $100 and begin your journey to creating a comfortable retirement today.
So if you only have a C-note to your name, and you don’t need that money to pay bills or for an emergency, then the following three stocks should be no-brainer stocks to buy this month.
Broadcom (AVGO)
Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com
At first glance, semiconductor stock Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO ) won’t intuitively seem a dead simple stock you should be buying with your $100. After all, shares trade for over $1,338 each. Even if you purchased fractional shares of AVGO stock, which is just a sliver of a whole share (it is totally possible and definitely worth doing), you’re not getting much for your money, right?
Wrong! You have to look at the quality of the company and not the price of a share. That’s why penny stocks are such a terrible idea. These are usually awful companies with little prospects for growth. But their cheap price makes them seem like such a deal. Unfortunately, you’re more likely to lose whatever money you put into them rather than make a killing. That is exactly why Broadcom is an excellent choice.
The chip stock for mobile communication companies has seen its fortunes grow with the proliferation of smartphones. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is a major source of revenue , accounting for 20% of the total. But the mobile market has a boom-bust cyclicality to it and Broadcom wants to smooth out those peaks and valleys. It has more recently steered its efforts towards software, and following the acquisition of VMWare last November, the chipmaker expects half of its revenue to come from this segment.
Broadcom stock also pays a dividend that has increased for 14 consecutive years. It has grown the payout at a 36% compounded annual growth rate ( CAGR ) over the last 10 years. Because you will enjoy capital appreciation buying this stock as well as get paid for owning it, Broadcom is the first no-brainer stock to buy.
Starbucks (SBUX)
Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com
Coffee slinger Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) is the next stock you should be buying with your $100. At $86 a share it is trading close to its 52-week low of $84 a stub. It’s a great price for this excellent company.
Starbucks stock is down in the dumps because of pressures on its international business. China is the company’s second-largest market with over 6,800 locations and the country’s slowing economy has weighed on performance. Similarly, its presence in the Middle East, though dramatically smaller in scope, is bearing the brunt of protests over the war between Israel and Palestinians. It also sees tougher competition here at home from Dunkin, Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS ) and McDonald’s (NYSE: MCD ).
Still, Starbucks enjoys growing sales and profits . In its fiscal first quarter, revenue rose 8% to a record $9.4 billion as comparable sales increased 5% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share jumped 20%. Analysts forecast the java shop will grow its profits at 15% annually for the next five years.
SBUX stock also pays a dividend that yields 2.6% annually and it has been growing the payout at a rate of over 8% a year for 13 years. This is another no-brainer buy this month at this deeply discounted level.
Visa (V)
Source: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com
The last stock to buy without much thinking is Visa (NYSE: V ), the No. 1 payments processor. It has some 4.3 billion Visa cards in circulation and generated $14.5 trillion in total payments and cash volume for the full fiscal year. Visa also enjoys immense profitability.
Because the payments processor merely lends it brand to credit issuers , Visa’s gross profit margins are 98%. Operating margins are an impressive 57% while net margins are only slightly lower at 50%. It makes the company a cash-generating machine.
Visa chooses to use a lot of that cash to return value to shareholders. Last October it announced it would be buying back $25 billion worth of stock, double the $12 billion it repurchased last year.
The payments company also pays a dividend that yields less than 1% annually. Yet it has been raising the payout at a torrid pace, hiking the dividend at almost 15% a year for the last five years. It just raised it 16% last year. Visa stock is a no-brainer stock to own now and for a lifetime.

2024-04-19,7 Battered Blue-Chip Stocks to Bounce From Your Portfolio This Spring,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
If your blue-chip stocks are underperforming, you have a big problem. Blue-chip stocks represent the best, most stable companies and can usually be considered solid performers. There are plenty of good names out there, so there’s no need to holding battered blue-chip stocks.
Even with some recent pullbacks, the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite are up 5% on the year. But the Dow Jones Industrial Average , which is comprised of 30 of the most prominent companies, is faltering. Its gains for the year are negligible at best.
Blue-chip stocks represent established companies that are leaders in their field. They often pay reliable dividends and are considered safe for long-term investors.
But you aren’t getting those generous returns from the blue-chip stocks on this list. For various reasons, these battered blue-chip stocks are taking it on the chin right now, and threatening to pull portfolios down with them.
The Portfolio Grader is an ideal tool for identifying blue-chip stocks that aren’t making the grade. The Portfolio Grader evaluates stocks based on earnings performance, growth, analyst sentiment and momentum, and assigns an “A” through “F” grade accordingly.
These blue-chip names are among the worst to have now. Act accordingly if you’re holding any of these equities.
Apple (AAPL)

It wasn’t too long ago that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) was the biggest company in the world by market capitalization. It was revered for innovative products, had a huge base of customers and was seemingly unlimited potential.
What in the heck happened to push AAPL to the ranks of battered blue-chip stocks?
But the shine on this Apple faded a bit last year, as iPhone sales slipped and earnings flattened. Apple saw drops in multiple products, including to Macs, home products, iPads and wearable technology.
It doesn’t help that Apple is facing huge challenges in China, where iPhone sales are down 24% in the first few weeks of the year, in part because competitor Huawei is now offering its own 5G smartphone.
Apple is also battling both the U.K. and U.S. on the legal front, with allegations that Apple’s App Store unfairly stymies competition.
Apple is still a great company. But as an investment, it’s best to leave it on the tree. AAPL stock is down 13% in 2024 and gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.
Tesla (TSLA)

Electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ: TLSA ) was on a dynamic run at the beginning of the decade, rising over 1,000% in a two-year span from January 2020 to December 2021. Since then? A huge disappointment.
There are a couple of factors at play. First, Tesla dominated the EV market in that two-year period, but naturally, other car manufacturers began entering the market and giving Tesla competition. Tesla responded by lowering the prices on some of its models to spur sales, and in turn cutting its own profit margin .
The second issue is Tesla CEO and founder Elon Musk. Tesla’s slip in stock price corresponds to his $44 billion purchase of the social media platform Twitter, which he rebranded to X . Musk sold billions of dollars in Tesla stock to finance the deal.
An activist at heart, Musk eagerly uses X as a platform to espouse controversial views and stir the pot. The drama makes Tesla a less appealing brand to would-be customers who don’t want to be seen as endorsing Musk’s brand of politics.
Tesla will report its first-quarter earnings on April 23 and analysts are already bracing for bad news . TSLA stock is down 37% in 2024 and gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.
Intel (INTC)

Semiconductor chip maker Intel (NYSE: INTC ) is facing some challenges. While its stock flails in 2024, bigger and better-heeled competitors are soaring on the power of generative AI chips, and in turn helping investors in those companies make money hand over fist.
So, it’s no surprise that tech stock investors are turning away from Intel.
The company’s foundry division posted a loss of $7 billion in 2023 as it attempts to compete with Taiwan Semiconductor (NASDAQ: TSM ), which already has the lion’s share of the foundry market.
Intel is still investing in the business, pouring billions of dollars into increasing capacity. It currently has a 1% market share in the foundry business, but hopes to be No. 2 in the world and start turning a profit by 2030 (TSMC has the top spot locked up with a 58% market share ).
I don’t know about you, but that’s a long time to ask investors to wait for foundry profits. INTC stock is down 29% this year and gets a “C” rating in the Portfolio Grader.
PayPal (PYPL)
PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL ) is a fintech stock that may have ahead of its time. The stock rose 170% from January 2020 to July 2021, the Covid-19 shutdown era in which e-commerce was pretty much the only way to buy and sell products.
It’s hard to believe that PayPal stock once topped $300. Now it could be had for less than $70. And while the company offers an impressive array of brands, including Zettle, Xoom, Venmo, Honey and Hyperwallet, there’s massive competition in the fintech space.
The number of active users fell from 435 million in 2022 to 431 million in 2023. If PayPal is going to turn around its slide, it will need to find a way to reverse that trend.
PYPL stock is up 3% so far in 2024 and gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.
Ford Motor Co. (F)
Source: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.com
Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F ) is one of the best-known brands in the world. As an automaker, Ford makes the F-150 pickup, the Explorer SUV and the sporty Mustang. It’s one of the Big Three Detroit automakers.
It’s been a challenge in recent months, however. Competition is always fierce, and Tesla’s move to lower its EV prices has a ripple effect for other automakers that Ford can’t ignore .
Ford also was one of three automakers that experienced a strike last year, and was forced to make significant wage concessions to get union members back on the job.
Ford saw an 81% jump in its EV sales in February, and overall sales increase by 6.8% in the first quarter . It remains to be seen how the company’s profit margins will hold, however, and how investors will react when it reports first-quarter earnings on April 24.
F stock is down 1% in 2024 and gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.
Boeing (BA)
Source: Alex JW Robinson / Shutterstock.com
Boeing (NYSE: BA ) is a nightmare stock to own right now. The aerospace and defense contractor is under serious pressure as a series of problems with its aircraft left investors reeling.
First, a rear door plug flew off a Boeing 737 Max 9 passenger jet in mid-flight. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded Boeing 737 Max 9 jets for inspection, and two airlines reported finding loose screws on their aircraft.
The FAA allowed the Max 9 to resume flying a few weeks later, but many passengers remain reluctant . The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board both issued critical reports of Boeing as well.
So unsurprisingly, Boeing stock is one of the worst performers of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2024, down 34%.
It’s going to be a rough period for Boeing in 2024 and there’s no need to try to catch a falling knife. BA stock has an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader.
Starbucks (SBUX)
Source: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com
Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) grew mightily from its roots in Seattle to be a dominant brand around the world. Starbucks has more than 39,000 locations, with plans to increase that to 55,000 by the end of the decade.
However, the stock is trading near its 52-week lows as customer traffic fell in the U.S. and China. Embattled Luckin Coffee (OTCMTKS: LKNCY ) surpassed Starbucks as China’s No. 1 coffeehouse with an aggressive expansion and pricing plan that undercuts Starbucks.
Starbucks saw its international store count and international revenue grow by 10% in 2023 – but operating margins slipped, and the company’s operating income remained flat for the year despite the expansion.
The company will need to find a way to turn its fortunes in China around without shaving off too much in margin and profitability. SBUX stock is down 10% in 2024 and gets an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader.

2024-04-12,XLK And The Return Of Irrational Exuberance,"Signs of irrational exuberance in the technology sector are becoming evident, with certain parts of the market trading significantly above trend.
The recently launched Destiny Tech100 closed-end fund is trading at around ten times net asset value, posing a risk for investors.
The XLK ETF has become excessively concentrated in a few names, with four companies representing more than half of the ETF's value.
We are increasingly seeing signs of irrational exuberance in the technology sector. Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict when the irrational behavior will end, or as John Maynard Keynes famously put it, ""markets can stay irrational for longer than you can stay solvent."" In any case, it is becoming clear that certain parts of the market are once again becoming a ""musical chairs"" game, where someone will be left holding the bag once valuations return to a reasonable level....",30

The Cupertino colossus abandoned plans to build its electric car, iPhone sales in China are drying up, and Apple even seems to have missed the boat on artificial intelligence -- to the extent it's had to ask Google for help ). Share prices of Apple stock are down about $20 from recent highs hit in January.
But that's not necessarily bad news for new investors.
Up until recently, writes JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee, investors ""have ... been averse to the premium valuation"" of Apple stock. But now that Apple's share price is a bit less premium, investors may be willing to give it a second look -- and once they do, they may like what they see.",30
2024-04-12,Apple: Why I Sold All My Shares,"Recently I sold all my Apple shares at about $182.
I sold primarily because the stock had gotten extremely expensive, not because I believed that the company's fortunes had gotten worse.
Apple is facing challenges in China, and its Vision Pro reportedly hasn't sold enough units to move the needle for the company.
I'm not expecting Apple to reveal that it grew a lot in the first quarter.
For this reason, I'm not buying any shares, despite the fact that Apple is now slightly cheaper than it was when I sold.
I sold all of my Apple ( AAPL ) stock earlier this year. I had bought the stock in 2022, at prices between $130 and $150, with an average cost around $145. My opinion on the stock did not change between the time I bought it and the time I sold, but the stock got considerably more expensive. I sold the stock at $182–pretty close to today’s price....",30
2024-04-12,Price-to-Earnings Perfection: 3 Stocks With Ideal P/E Ratios,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Identifying stocks with ideal P/E ratios that offer consistency and stability can be important. On the one hand, underperforming or overvalued stocks may be cheap for a good reason. On the other hand, stocks that have been rising rapidly could be due for a correction.
Some stocks see wide fluctuations in their (price-to-earnings) P/E ratio, which could indicate that investors are reacting emotionally to that asset. For some traders, that type of movement may present opportunities, but for others, it signifies increased risk due to less predictable price behavior. A prudent strategy is to focus on stocks with P/E ratios that avoid the extremes and demonstrate stability.
Stocks with ideal P/E ratios offer promise. Of course, reasonable valuation metrics may vary depending on investment style. However, some companies are neither overvalued nor undervalued, trading at fair value. In an uptrending market, a balanced approach concentrating on stocks with ideal P/E ratios could help generate consistent gains with less stress versus trying to identify extreme movers.
Typically, stocks have an approximate P/E ratio of 20x, though the ratio depends on the industry . More important than the specific numeric ratio is the company’s financial performance. For a stock maintaining a stable P/E, rising earnings that track the stock price indicate the company is executing well operationally. After all, the P/E ratio is the division of the company’s stock price by its earnings. Solid fundamentals suggest the ability to continue delivering share price appreciation and dividend growth in line with profits.
Here are some stocks with ideal P/E ratios suitable for investors seeking stability and consistency:
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Moab Republic / Shutterstock
It should be no surprise that one of Warren Buffett’s preferred valued stocks would make the cut. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is one of the stocks with ideal P/E ratios that generate consecutive solid growth over time. It is currently trading at a P/E ratio of 26.3x , which is actually below the S&P 500 index.
While this may be slightly higher than the long-term average P/E ratio of 20x for most stocks, Apple has the advantage of being a well-established brand. More importantly, Apple has consistently grown its earnings for over a decade, and its brand retains investors’ confidence. This could help keep its share price aligned with earnings going forward, maintaining an ideal P/E ratio.
Coca-Cola (KO)
Source: phloxii / Shutterstock.com
Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ) is another one of the stocks with ideal P/E ratios. As a leading beverage company, Coca-Cola tends to experience stable growth as demand for its products remains consistent through different economic conditions.
While share price increases may be modest for KO, the company offers investors a relatively high dividend yield of 3.3% . Notably, The stock currently trades at a P/E ratio near the optimal stock average of 24x, making it one of the stocks with ideal P/E ratios. Analysis shows Coca-Cola’s P/E ratio has been consistently at or above this level since 2018. That year, earnings were impacted by a one-time tax impact of changes under the Trump administration.
JPMorgan Chase (JPM)
Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM ) is the final pick of stocks with ideal P/E ratios. It has built significant reserves in anticipation of a potential economic downturn predicted by its CEO last year. With the U.S. economy now appearing poised for a soft landing, the largest bank in the country has ample resources to reward shareholders through dividends and support its stock price.
Based on its upcoming quarterly earnings report, the company is also well-positioned to benefit from interest rate conditions . At a P/E ratio of 12.1x, JPM trades in line with the average for the U.S. banking sector of 11.8x. It represents one of the stocks with ideal P/E ratios , given its relatively consistent earnings growth over the past decade when profits have tripled . This could provide long-term holders stability through consistent growth.

Despite 2024 Wall Street stock euphoria, however, the bond market is signaling that it doesn’t quite agree with the Fed’s prediction of its own actions, particularly concerning future projections beyond this year.
Dear clients and fellow shareholders:
Over a period as short as a few months – or even a year – stock prices can be influenced by almost anything, including factors that are completely unrelated to the actual values of the underlying businesses.

2024-04-12,Why Am I Upgrading Apple Stock To 'Buy',"I previously had a ""Sell"" rating on Apple stock, but am now upgrading it to ""Buy"" due to a decrease in valuation and potential positive earnings report. Read on.
The company's margins are rising amid challenges, while the bottom-line figures also expand. Apple continues to be a real cash flow machine as I see it.
In my opinion, the market, represented by 32 analysts, has formed too negative a forecast for Apple, creating fertile ground for another EPS beat in May.
Apple stock is starting to appear fairly valued, even though its multiples are slightly above average. Should the premium come back, AAPL may soar 8-11% at least in a matter of weeks.
Another reason for today's upgrade is the technical potential for AAPL stock to rebound. I am upgrading AAPL from ""Sell"" to ""Buy"" and recommend considering the stock (at least) in the medium term.
My Thesis
My only article on Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) stock was published on January 19, 2024 , with a ""Sell"" rating, as I expected relative weakness in AAPL at the time due to iPhone demand potential issues and the extremely high valuation. Since then, the stock has fallen by more than 11%, while the S&P 500 Index ( SP500 ) ( SPX ) has risen by 7.65% so the timing in this case was on my side:

Artificial intelligence isn’t going anywhere. Bloomberg Intelligence forecasts that the generative AI market will grow to $1.3 trillion over the next 10 years from $40 billion in 2022. The technology promises to change all our lives in both small and big ways. The future is both exciting and a little intimidating when it comes to the brave new world of AI.
While most technology companies are racing ahead with AI technologies, some have set themselves apart from the pack. These are companies that are racing ahead with the technology and finding ways to quickly monetize it and boost their bottom lines. While analysts agree that we are in the early innings of the AI revolution, they clearly see winners emerging in the space . Here are three AI stocks to turn $10,000 into $1 million: April 2024.
Palantir Technologies (PLTR)
Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com
Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR ) is leveraging AI to bolster its data analytics service, and the results have been impressive. Largely because of its use of AI, PLTR stock has risen 167% over the last 12 months, including a 35% gain so far this year. The company’s stock jumped nearly 20% higher after the data analytics company’s most recent financial results were made public. Specifically, Palantir reported that its revenue increased 20% from a year earlier.
The growth at Palantir has been attributed to demand for AI, which the company’s CEO Alex Karp has repeatedly called “unrelenting.” To capitalize on the opportunity, Palantir is rolling out a new AI platform and making it available to both its government and commercial clients . Palantir has now reported four consecutive quarters of profitability, and rumors are growing that PLTR stock will be added to the benchmark S&P 500 index by year’s end.
Apple (AAPL)

Don’t sleep on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). The leading technology company has lagged behind in AI so far, but that could change quickly. The company is hosting its annual Worldwide Developers Conference from June 10 to 14 , and there is speculation the company will announce new AI products at the event. In February of this year, Apple CEO Tim Cook said Apple is “investing significantly” in AI and that there would be an AI announcement by the company this year.
More recently, there have been media reports that Apple is in talks with Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) about licensing Gemini AI technology for future editions of the iPhone. It has also been reported that Apple is developing robots for use in the home after canceling its electric vehicle project. Multiple media reports say that engineers at Apple are in the early stages of developing a robot that can follow users around their homes and perform basic tasks. This is all to say that Apple could emerge as a major AI player.
AAPL stock is down 8% this year. Buy the dip!
Meta Platforms (META)

Meta Platforms has pivoted aggressively from the metaverse to focus on AI. The company is working overtime to cascade AI across its social media platforms, virtual reality headsets, and other applications. As a result, Meta Platforms has become a huge buyer of AI microchips and semiconductors. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that the company could spend billions of dollars this year buying microchips from Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and others.
In a post on Instagram, Zuckerberg said the company will have 350,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) and about 600,000 H100 compute equivalent GPUs by the end of 2024. “Our long-term vision is to build general intelligence, open source it responsibly, and make it widely available so everyone can benefit,” wrote Zuckerberg on social media. Owing to its growing push into AI , META stock has been a huge gainer, rising 142% in the past 12 months, including a 50% increase so far in 2024.

2024-04-11,All-Time High Flyers: 7 Stocks to Buy as the Market Peaks,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
If you’re wondering which stocks to buy in April, here’s a good place to start. The stock market is off to a difficult start in the second quarter. With the timing of interest rates getting pushed out further, the major averages have turned downwards. Since peaking on March 28, the benchmark S&P 500 index has declined nearly 2%. The dip has some on Wall Street wondering aloud if we’re at or close to the market’s peak and now entering what could be a steep selloff. Many analysts say a pullback is overdue with all three major stock indices hitting all-time highs throughout the first quarter.
The S&P 500 gained more than 25% from the end of October through the end of March, which is quite a strong rally. Stocks in certain sectors rallied particularly hard, notably artificial intelligence ( AI ), semiconductors, cybersecurity, and weight-loss medications. But much of the rally was predicated on expectations for lower interest rates, the timing of which has been thrown into doubt with inflation remaining high and the economy showing resilience. Here are all-time high flyers: seven stocks to buy as the market peaks.
Stocks to Buy: Microsoft (MSFT)
Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com
Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) continues to assert its dominance in AI and its stock has been responding. In the last 12 months, MSFT stock has increased nearly 50% , including a 15% increase this year. The company and its stock continue to be viewed as one of the best ways to play the bull market in AI that is helping to push the stock market to record highs. Recently, Microsoft further expanded its global reach in AI, announcing an investment of $2.90 billion to enhance its AI business in Japan.
The money, which represents Microsoft’s biggest ever investment in Japan , will go towards the development of advanced AI semiconductors at two facilities in the Asian nation. Microsoft also plans to allocate funds towards an AI reskilling program in Japan that will see three million workers trained on the technology. And, the company plans to establish a new AI lab in Tokyo for research and development on robotics and machine learning. This is just the latest example of how Microsoft is staying ahead in the AI race.
Coinbase (COIN)

In addition to AI, another major catalyst for the market continues to be cryptocurrencies. And one of the best ways to play the boom in crypto is to own shares of Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN ). Shares of the cryptocurrency exchange have been white hot amid the rise in crypto prices. In the last 12 months, COIN stock has risen 277% . Already in 2024, the company’s share price has gained 60%. Despite the big rally, analysts see more upside ahead for Coinbase and its shareholders.
Analysts at Wall Street firm Oppenheimer (NYSE: OPY ) recently raised their price target on COIN stock to $276 from $200 and reiterated a “buy” rating on the shares. The price target is 11% higher than where Coinbase’s stock currently trades. In a research note, Oppenheimer said that Coinbase is likely to benefit from the long-term adoption of blockchain technology. The brokerage also raised its earning estimates for Coinbase.
The analyst upgrade comes as Coinbase announced that it has received regulatory approval to begin operating its cryptocurrency exchange in Canada. Coinbase, which is one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, has now become the biggest crypto trading platform north of the border.
Stocks to Buy: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM)

No corner of the market is hotter right now than semiconductor stocks . Microchips and semiconductors are viewed as the key to unlocking the potential of AI, fueling a huge rally. And among chip and semi stocks, one of the best to own is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE: TSM ), commonly known as TSMC. The Taiwanese company currently manufacturers more than half (50%) of all the microchips in the world, with some estimates putting its market share as high as 60% .
The dominance of TSMC when it comes to making microchips and semiconductors for third parties such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has pushed its share price sharply higher. Through 12 months, TSM stock is up 62% and currently trading near its all-time high. The company and stock just got a boost from news that the U.S. government is giving it $6.60 billion to help fund the construction of microchip fabrication plants in Arizona.
The government funding is coming from the U.S. CHIPS Act that aims to increase America’s chip security and lessen the country’s reliance on foreign made microchips and semiconductors. TSMC is spending about $65 billion to build three cutting-edge fabrication plants in Phoenix, Arizona. In announcing the funding, the U.S. government said that TSMC’s Arizona plants have already created more than 25,000 jobs and attracted 14 semiconductor suppliers to the southwestern state.
GE Aerospace (GE)

Now that General Electric has successfully divided itself into three publicly traded companies, it might be an opportune time to invest in GE Aerospace (NYSE: GE ), which retains the company’s original industrial business, including its aircraft engine manufacturing unit. Not only has GE stock doubled in the past 12 months as the company hived itself into three, but GE Aerospace just announced that it is raising its quarterly dividend payment to shareholders by an astounding 250%.
Going forward, GE Aerospace will pay a quarterly dividend of 28 cents per share, up from eight cents previously. Last fall, management outlined plans to return 75% of the company’s free cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and buybacks once the dust settled on the three-way split. GE Aerospace has said that it expects to generate more than $5 billion of free cash flow this year, which could lead to windfall for current and future shareholders. This makes GE Aerospace a stock to buy as the market peaks.
Stocks to Buy: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
Now for a buy-the-dip candidate. Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ) has seen its stock decline 5% so far in 2024. Through 12 months, the company’s share price is down 7%. Now might be the time to buy JNJ stock as the company continues to grow through an acquisition strategy. Johnson & Johnson has just announced that it is buying Shockwave Medical (NASDAQ: SWAV ) for $13.10 billion as it grows its treatments for heart disease and other pulmonary ailments.
The purchase of Shockwave Medical is the largest by Johnson & Johnson since its $16.60 billion acquisition of heart pump maker Abiomed in 2022. Shockwave Medical specializes in medical devices that use shockwaves to break down calcified plaque in heart vessels. It’s a process that is similar to how kidney stones are broken apart and removed. Under terms of the deal, Johnson & Johnson has agreed to pay $335 per share in cash to acquire Shockwave Medical. The acquisition is expected to close this summer.
United Parcel Service (UPS)

Another stock that looks like a deal at current levels is United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS ). The company’s stock is also down 5% this year and looks cheap right now trading at 19 times future earnings estimates and with a quarterly dividend that yields 4.34%. Like the other names on this list, goods things are happening at United Parcel Service with catalysts that are likely to send UPS stock higher in the coming months.
Specifically, United Parcel Service has just struck a deal to become the primary air cargo provider for the U.S. Postal Service, replacing archrival Federal Express (NYSE: FDX ). FedEx previously had the air cargo contract with the U.S. Postal Service for 22 years and earned $1.73 billion from it in 2023. The contract with the U.S. Postal Service now switches to United Parcel Service in September of this year and will give its earnings a boost going forward. UPS stock has declined 21% over the last year.
Novo Nordisk (NVO)
Source: joreks / Shutterstock.com
In healthcare, nothing is working right now quite as well as weight-loss drugs. And Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO ) is leading in this area with its in-demand medications Ozempic and Wegovy . Sales of the weight-loss drugs are rising fast, sending NVO stock higher as a result. Over the past 12 months, Novo Nordisk’s share price has gained 57%, including a 22% increase so far in 2024. The growth has made Novo Nordisk one of Europe’s largest publicly traded companies with a market capitalization of nearly half a trillion dollars.
Even with the growth from the weight-loss drugs, the Danish pharmaceutical giant isn’t sitting idle. Novo Nordisk has announced that it is buying privately held Cardior Pharmaceuticals for $1.10 billion. The acquisition strengthens Novo Nordisk’s pipeline of cardiovascular medications. The company has said that it is expanding its diabetes and weight-loss drugs to also include cardiovascular and heart treatments.
The acquisition includes Cardior Pharmaceuticals’ lead compound CDR132L that is in Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of heart failure. The purchase of Cardior is expected to close in the current second quarter.
On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA, AAPL and MSFT. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines .

2024-04-11,How to Profit From Elon Musk's $18 Billion AI Project,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The global AI Race has begun, and it’s off to a red-hot start. Companies like Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ) and Apple ( AAPL ) – among countless others – are all pouring billions of dollars into this groundbreaking tech.
Why? Because they know that the winner of the AI Race will inevitably become the world’s most powerful company.
But funnily enough, the ultimate winner may not be any of those Big Tech companies.
Rather, it may be a company that you’ve likely never heard of before…
I’m talking about xAI, Elon Musk’s newest AI startup.
A New AI Frontrunner?
About a year ago, Elon Musk set out to create his own AI startup, xAI. He felt that his competitors were all missing the ultimate goal of creating powerful and fair AI. Now, just over a year later, that startup is working to raise $3 billion at an $18 billion valuation.
That is huge growth for a company in just under a year.
But xAI’s growth story could just be getting started.
After all, Apple didn’t become Apple because of the iPhone. It became Apple because of Steve Jobs.
Microsoft didn’t become Microsoft because of Windows. It became Microsoft because of Bill Gates.
World-changing people create world-changing businesses.
So… if you want to invest in world-changing businesses… start by investing in world-changing people.
We certainly believe that Elon Musk is a world-changer.
He co-founded PayPal ( PYPL ), the world’s largest digital payment platform, now worth more than $70 billion…
And SpaceX , the world’s largest private space rocket firm, now worth $180 billion.
He pioneered the world’s largest automaker in Tesla ( TSLA ), which is now worth more than all of the next 10 biggest automakers combined…
And he’s also the man behind Neuralink , The Boring Company , and X .
Musk has influenced how we pay for things, what cars we drive, how we communicate online, how we see space…
I’d venture to say that he is one of the most influential business figures of the past 20 years.
A great example of world-changing.
The Final Word
And now this world-changing person has turned his focus to a new business venture at the heart of possibly the most transformative technology the world has ever seen: AI.
Would you bet against him here?
I don’t think I would.
xAI has already launched an impressive AI chatbot named Grok, which many experts claim stacks up pound-for-pound against ChatGPT. And as we mentioned above, the firm is already in talks to raise $3 billion at an $18 billion valuation.
This latest startup is moving fast. With impressive progress. And the journey is likely just getting started.
Because xAI could be Musk’s biggest venture yet.
And right now, you have an opportunity to invest in it.
Now, not directly, of course – xAI is barely a year old. It is still a private startup.
But we have found a potentially huge “backdoor” investment opportunity into xAI. It’s a stock that you’ve likely have never heard of before, but we think it could be xAI’s leading tech component supplier.
If xAI becomes a champion of the multi-trillion-dollar AI race, then this stock could absolutely soar.
Get all the details about this little-known supplier.

This saw the firm’s analysts increase their price target for NVDA stock from $850 per share to $1,100 per share . That’s a potential upside of 26.4% compared to its prior closing price. It’s also above the analyst consensus price prediction of $926.30 per share.

What’s Behind the Bull Stance on NVDA Stock?
Here’s what the Raymond James analysts had to say about Nvidia in a note to clients obtained by Seeking Alpha :
“We believe concerns regarding a potential pause in customer spending ahead of Blackwell ramps are unwarranted as Inferencing demand continues to outpace GPU supply […] We expect H200 to be a key near-term driver followed by B100 / B200 ramps in 2H24. Our recent conversations in Asia point to a significant mix shift in favor of GB200 NVL systems, which positions NVDA to capture additional share of [data center] capex.”

A massive Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) spyware warning has the company alerting owners of its products about a “mercenary spyware attack.”
The latest spyware warning from Apple focused on iPhone owners in India and 91 other countries. It alerted them to a spyware that was attempting to install itself on their devices.
The spyware warning has Apple claiming the following in emails sent to users, as reported by Forbes :
“Apple detected that you are being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack that is trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID […] This attack is likely targeting you specifically because of who you are or what you do. Although it’s never possible to achieve absolute certainty when detecting such attacks, Apple has high confidence in this warning—please take it seriously.”
Who Is Behind the Apple Spyware Warning?
It’s unknown who exactly is behind the malware that triggered this latest spyware warning. However, it could be state actors, as Apple has run into trouble with this in the past. This means the attack is likely targeting the types of individuals that governments would want to keep an eye on.
In fact, the tech company has sent similar warnings out to customers in more than 150 countries over the last three years. That includes mercenary spyware attacks targeting customers in India in October. That was tied back to Israeli spyware maker NSO Group .

How are you thinking about things? Here we are nearing the mid-April section of 2024. How are you thinking about and looking at the tech sector these days?
JA : Yeah. Well, I'd say I'd start back in late 2022 when kind of the AI mainstream – kind of what mainstream and everything started picking up. It felt like a lot like the cryptocurrency boom back in like 2018 kind of era, where everybody suddenly talked about AI on their earnings reports and their conference calls. And it became one of those situations where you had to decipher who was going to really benefit and where it was going to show up in the financials. And then you had to separate things that were outside of AI.
So you had cyber security, which has always been something that had to be on the leading edge. And AI would always be a perfect kind of endpoint for cybersecurity to do things better and faster than humans to prevent threats, for threats to deal with all that kind of stuff.

2024-04-15,Riding the AI Wave: Why Microsoft Stock Remains a Worthy Portfolio Play,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
There’s no denying it. Microsoft’s (NASDAQ: MSFT ) investments in generative artificial intelligence technology turned out to be brilliant, forward-looking moves. Whether you choose to add to your position or just keep your current shares, Microsoft stock remains a worthy portfolio holding and earns a confident “B” grade today.
Microsoft remains a leader in the AI market. The company is building an AI-development center in Europe. Furthermore, an analyst compared Microsoft’s current situation to another tech titan’s historic moment. Depending on your position, you can decide if Microsoft stock is a buy, hold, or both.
Microsoft Advances AI in the UK
Here’s a news item that’s bound to capture Wall Street’s attention. Microsoft is reportedly establishing a new AI hub in London. Mustafa Suleyman will lead this hub; he’s a co-founder of AI-tech firm DeepMind, which Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google owns.
This AI-development hub, according to Suleyman, will “drive pioneering work to advance state-of-the-art language models and their supporting infrastructure, and to create world-class tooling for foundation models.” If all goes according to plan, the new AI hub will enable Microsoft to tap into the UK’s “extraordinary talent pool and AI ecosystem.”
Undoubtedly, this will entail substantial capital commitment from Microsoft in the short term. However, AI isn’t just a fad; it’s here to stay. To maintain its leadership position, Microsoft needs to find and hire top talent. So, even if it involves a sizable capital outlay, Microsoft’s new AI hub should be well worth the cost.
Is Microsoft Really Having an ‘iPhone Moment’?
It’s fine to be enthusiastic about Microsoft’s AI-related investments, but investors should temper their enthusiasm.
Consider, for example, a declaration made by Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. He’s highly respected, so when Ives makes a statement, people listen.
Not long ago, Ives asserted Microsoft is having its “iPhone moment” with the AI revolution . That’s an extremely bullish statement, as Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone, the first globally mass-marketed smartphone, altered the course of history.
Maybe, OpenAI’s ChatGPT AI chatbot is also a history-making technology. Microsoft has a has a 49% stake in ChatGPT, so at least it is associated with a game-changing technology phenomenon.
However, there’s no need to over-invest in Microsoft stock even if you expect the AI-tech market to grow exponentially. Only in time will we know whether this truly is an “iPhone moment” for Microsoft. Jumping to hasty conclusions really won’t benefit anyone at this point.
Microsoft Stock: Consider How Much You Need
It makes sense, given the company’s leadership status in the AI-technology market, to maintain a share stake in Microsoft. If this truly is Microsoft’s “iPhone moment,” then investors will want to be positioned for long-term gains.
Of course, make your own financial decisions. You could just hold the Microsoft shares you already own. Or, if you’re under-invested, you might choose to add a few shares now. Either way, Microsoft stock earns a “B” grade as it offers exposure to a top-notch technology giant.

2024-04-14,Wall Street Favorites: 3 Magnificent 7 Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for April 2024,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The Magnificent 7 stocks stood head and shoulders above the rest last year. These powerhouse stocks helped the S&P 500 notch fresh highs in 2023, with the index delivering more than a 20% gain.
However, despite a strong first half of 2024, these stocks have been trading in the red in recent weeks. Following an incredible rally over the past several months, I’m sure many had expected the stock market to take a breather. Nevertheless, the pullback calls for a moment of reflection for investors, who should place their bets on the Magnificent 7 stocks having the most prolonged growth potential.
In doing so, here are three Magnificent 7 stocks that offer the most potential for sustained long-term gains ahead. These three stocks contributed billions to the stock market’s gains in the past year and have proven incredibly lucrative over time.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com
Most, if not all, Magnificent 7 stocks are ticking in the green this year again, but that’s not the case with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). AAPL stock is down more than 9% this year, with several headwinds weighing down its underlying business. Demand for its products is down, particularly in China, while it looks to navigate an antitrust lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice. Nevertheless, the current drop in its price, makes it an excellent ‘buy-the-dip’ candidate, especially with its upcoming generative AI innovations.
Though it has been relatively sluggish in the AI realm, Apple has the potential to catch up and then some. All eyes will be on its annual Worldwide Developers Conference , set for June this year, likely to include multiple AI product announcements. In February, Apple CEO Tim Cook discussed the company’s significant investment in AI, promising a major AI-related announcement this year.
Meta (META)
Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com
Meta (NASDAQ: META ) emerged as one of the top-performing stocks last year, gaining an eye-catching 145% . Its pivot from the metaverse to AI and its effective belt-tightening measures resulted in Meta’s stellar operating performance last year. It surpassed analyst estimates across both lines by handsome margins in each of the four quarters last year.
Its fourth-quarter (Q4) results show a superb 25% bump in sales on a year-over-year (YOY) basis to $40.11 billion, while it more than tripled its net income. Moreover, it ended Q4 with daily active users up 8% YOY to $3.19 billion, with monthly active users jumping 6%. Also, it initiated its first dividend and repurchased a hefty $6.32 billion in shares in Q4.
As we advance, AI will continue to be a major growth catalyst for Meta as it seamlessly layers the transformative technology across its Family of Apps and its hardware products. Moreover, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has indicated plans to spend billions on microchips from Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and its peers this year to develop responsible open-source general intelligence in the long term.
Nvidia (NVDA)

It’s tough to discuss AI without mentioning semiconductor giant Nvidia. Its cutting-edge GPUs accelerate the most demanding AI algorithms, positioning the company as a cornerstone in the industry. Moreover, its comprehensive hardware and software stack empowers developers to innovate faster. With AI’s disruption unlikely to stop anytime soon, Nvidia and its investors will continue to reap the rewards for years to come.
Nevertheless, after a couple of years of roughly 300% gains, it’s not too hard to imagine why investors are feeling iffy. Consequently, we’ve seen NVDA stock taking a hit in the past few weeks, down almost 5% from its all-time high of $950. However, despite the lofty price tag, Morgan Stanley analysts like Joseph Moore continue to champion the stock with it currently in correction territory. He raised the price target for NVDA stock to a parabolic $1,000, a testament to its massive long-term growth trajectory.

2024-04-14,VIX: Wall Street's 'Fear Signal' Says It's Buying Season,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Right now, the prospect of escalating geopolitical conflict in the Middle East has many investors running for the hills. But in fact, Wall Street’s famous ‘fear gauge’ – the VIX – is signaling that they should be doing the opposite. It seems that now may actually be a great time to buy stocks.
The Volatility Index (VIX) is widely considered Wall Street’s ‘fear gauge.’ It measures the stock market’s expected volatility based on S&P 500 index options. So, in that respect, it measures how worried investors are about the market at any given point in time.
It’s a sentiment indicator. And like most sentiment indicators, it is often a contrarian signal.
As the legendary Warren Buffet once said, “It pays to be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy.”
That certainly is the case with the VIX – especially so over the past year.
Why the VIX Has Us Bullish on Stocks
Since early 2023, the VIX has typically fluctuated between 12 and 16. But every single time it has spiked above 18, stocks were on the verge of a huge upward rally. In fact, the best times to buy stocks since early 2023 were when the index spiked above 18.
This happened in April/May 2023, when investors were worried about the Silicon Valley Bank collapse and a potential regional bank crisis that could send the economy into a recession. The VIX spiked above 18. But that dreaded recession never arrived. And over the next three months, stocks popped almost 15%.
It also happened in October 2023. Investors were worried that reinflation would force the Federal Reserve to hike rates again. Consequently, the VIX spiked above 18. But inflation proceeded to cool, and the Fed never did hike rates again. Then over the next five months, stocks soared nearly 30%.
And as you might have guessed, the volatility index is spiking above 18 again right now as investors worry about war, reinflation, and a potential recession.
But we think it’s unlikely that these risks will amount to much of anything. Instead, we expect that the U.S. economy will continue to grow while inflation resumes its decline.
And as these risks fade over the coming weeks and months, the stock market should rally in a big way – just like it did in the summer and winter of 2023.
In other words, the VIX is telling us that it is buying season for stocks.
Sure, that may run counter to everything you’re hearing in the news at the moment. But remember: it’s a reporter’s job to scare you with sensationalized headlines and keep watching (or reading) their stuff.
But my job is to make you money.
And the data is telling me that, right now, we have the opportunity to do just that.
The Final Word
We’re telling our readers to buy the dip in stocks right now because we think this pullback will end soon. And when it does, the stocks we’re buying right now should absolutely soar into the summer.
That’s our opinion; but we think time will prove us right.
And we’re pounding the table on one under-the-radar AI stock in particular.
We think it may be the No. 1 way to play the generational AI Boom.
But moreover, we think it offers investors the perfect backdoor way into what we see as the most interesting AI startup in the world.
Of course, while Big Tech titans like Microsoft ( MSFT ), Alphabet ( GOOGL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Apple ( AAPL ), Nvidia ( NVDA ), and others are duking it out for AI supremacy…
The real winner of this race may be  a ‘dark horse’ startup that most investors haven’t heard of yet…
One that’s backed by one of the richest men in the world, Elon Musk…
And we’ve found a way for you to invest in this promising startup that could shock the world over coming months and years.
Dig into the details.

2024-04-14,"1 Stock That Turned $1,000 Into More Than $1.7 Million","Every investor would agree that the stock market is a fantastic asset class for people to build life-changing wealth. Compounding can work its magic, leading to tremendous results.
However, there are specific businesses that have absolutely crushed the market, as defined by the S&P 500 . Just look at tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) . The iPhone maker has produced a total return for its shareholders of 170,000% ever since it started trading on the public markets in December 1980. That monster gain means a $1,000 investment back then would be worth a jaw-dropping $1.7 million today.
Apple has undoubtedly been one of corporate America's most prominent success stories, so it's worthwhile to look back and try to understand what factors contributed to its rise. Then, we can answer if the consumer discretionary stock is a worthy portfolio addition today.",30
2024-04-14,"If You'd Invested $2,000 in Apple in 2011, This Is How Much You Would Have Today","Tim Cook succeeded Steve Jobs as Apple 's (NASDAQ: AAPL) CEO on Aug. 24, 2011. Just six weeks later, Jobs passed away from pancreatic cancer. At the time, many investors considered Jobs' death to be the end of an era.
Jobs had returned to Apple on Sept. 16, 1997 -- exactly 12 years after being ousted from the company he co-founded -- and revived its ailing business with the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. Under Jobs, Apple disrupted the PC, MP3 player, smartphone, and tablet computer markets with its sleekly designed and easy-to-use products.
From fiscal 1997 to fiscal 2011 (which ended in September 2011), Apple's annual revenue increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22% from $7.1 billion to $108.3 billion. From Jobs' first day back to Cook's ascension as its CEO, Apple's stock rallied 6,760%. A modest $2,000 investment would have grown to $137,200.",30
2024-04-13,QQQ: The Big Tech Is Fundamentally Vulnerable,"The big tech firms, accounting for 45% of QQQ, are facing serious threats, either due to regulations, antitrust issues, or AI-related disruptions.

The momentum is also weakening, as QQQ has been flat for 6 weeks, facing a major technical breakdown with a 10% correction.
The Big Tech story
Before discussing the reasons why the Big Tech could be fundamentally vulnerable, it's important to understand the Big Tech story.

2024-04-13,3 Red-Hot Stocks With Long-Term Growth Potential,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Many value investors may ignore the red-hot stocks in the market just because of their momentum. Undoubtedly, stocks that surge by double-digit percentage points in a matter of weeks are too hot to touch for many investors. So, momentum alone does not indicate a bubble or even overvaluation.
As long as the fundamentals are improving and the earnings growth is moving accordingly, stock price appreciation may be warranted. And, you may have situations where high-flying stocks appear cheaper after a sizable upward move.
Let’s check three momentum stocks that have the potential to be long-term winners.
Nvidia (NVDA)
Source: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com
Based on traditional valuation metrics, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) stock certainly looks cheaper after its latest blowout quarter. Still, many may continue to slam Nvidia as a bubble, even as it readies its next generation of chips to fuel a demand boom that Nvidia alone may not be able to fill alone.
Finishing Thursday’s session up more than 4%, the AI chip kingpin bounced back from a brief correction. Now, that’s starting to look like a pretty solid, albeit short-lived, buying opportunity. With the $1,000 level realistically in sight, rushing to the exits may prove ill-timed, especially as Blackwell looks to repeat the magic in 2024.
Undoubtedly, there’s a high bar to pass for NVDA now that expectations have risen so high. However, at 36.1 times forward price-to-earnings ( P/E ), the stock actually looks too cheap for its own good. True, the chances are high that Nvidia stock’s multi-year bull run will end in a painful sell-off. Until then, though, you’ll have to look far and wide to find something to be bearish about.
Perhaps Nvidia’s numerous collaborations with other tech titans, as outlined in its 2024 GTC conference, could be key to keeping growth going strong. Either way, I don’t think it’s too late to hop aboard the NVDA stock bandwagon as long as a 20-40% drop over the near term won’t deter you.
Amazon (AMZN)
Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com
Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is another tech juggernaut that’s making the most of the great AI bull market. Recently, shares hit all-time highs for the first time since mid-2021. It has a larger $4 billion stake in Anthropic and a more deliberate investment strategy that entails cautious strategic cost cuts and aggressive AI spending. Thus, Amazon may be in a spot to take its growth to the next level.
Also, Amazon’s AI-focused growth story may seem somewhat similar to its public cloud peers. The company is betting big on its own AI acceleration hardware. In fact, it spares no expense in investing in third-party large language model ( LLM ) companies. And, it’s been doubling down on the cloud’s AI-focused future.
What sets Amazon apart from the pack, though, is its legendary management team’s hunger to disrupt. CEO Andy Jassy is serious about capitalizing on the generative AI revolution while minimizing expenses where possible. Perhaps big bets in AI today may lead to the biggest cuts down the road. Either way, I would not dare bet against the company now that its stock is chasing new highs again.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Moab Republic / Shutterstock
Never discount Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and its ability to innovate in a fast-moving, AI-driven technological landscape. The stock surprised many when it blasted off 4.33% over $175 per share on Thursday on news that its coming M4 chip will be AI-focused.
Indeed, an AI-driven M4 could breathe new life into the company’s stagnant Mac business. And it may do so sooner than many skeptics think, with the chip that could land as soon as this year.
Indeed, the Mac is a relatively small part of Apple’s business as it stands today. And so, it could grow to contribute a larger piece of Apple’s revenue pie in the near future if it makes AI PCs better than rivals.
Combined with a robust services business (perhaps an AI service will be in Apple’s future) and the potential for an AI-powered A-series chip for a future AI-focused iPhone, AAPL remains one of the best deals. It’s just 27.2 times trailing price-to-earnings.

Editor’s note: “ AI Stocks : Growing Wealth in the Dot-Com Boom 2.0″ was previously published in March 2024. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.
Believe it or not, you’re living through a modern version of the 1990s Dot-Com Boom. This time, it’s not the internet but AI technology that’s poised to have an even more significant economic impact on the world.
In the 1990s, the internet emerged as a groundbreaking technology, promising to make everything faster, more efficient, and more productive, while automating numerous tedious tasks. Now, in the early 2020s, AI technology is making similar promises, aiming to revolutionize how we shop, work, and travel.
In the 1990s, hundreds of internet startups emerged across America, attracting billions of dollars in investments. These startups vowed to leverage the internet to transform daily human activities. Similarly, in the early 2020s, a surge of AI startups has appeared, receiving substantial funding and promising to harness artificial intelligence to bring about significant changes in various sectors.
During the 1990s, many pundits and skeptics dismissed the internet as a fleeting trend. In contrast, some of the world’s most insightful futurists and investors predicted it would be the most significant innovation ever seen. Today, we see a similar pattern with AI: skepticism from some, yet predictions from experts that AI will be a groundbreaking innovation.
In the 1990s, internet stocks soared. Now, in the early 2020s, AI stocks are on a similar trajectory, mirroring the path internet stocks took three decades ago.
The Parallels Are Uncanny
The parallels between the AI Boom and the Dot-Com Boom are striking, extending even to boardroom dramas.
For instance, Steve Jobs was famously ousted from Apple ( AAPL ), the leading computer company of its time, only to return years later. Recently, Sam Altman faced a similar situation at OpenAI , the forefront AI company, but returned within days.
This difference in time reflects the primary distinction between the two booms: the AI Boom is unfolding much more rapidly .
The Dot-Com Boom was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and now the AI Boom is unfolding even faster, presenting a chance you can’t afford to miss. For retail investors, this is your golden ticket to potentially life-changing wealth.
The Final Word on Investing in AI
Right now, AI stocks and related investments are not just options. They’re necessities for those who want to stay ahead in the game. The AI Revolution is charging forward, and the time to act is right now.
Luckily for you, there is still time to catch a ride on this bullet train.
Because the biggest gains in the AI Boom have yet to come.
See; while Big Tech titans like Microsoft ( MSFT ), Alphabet ( GOOGL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Apple, Nvidia ( NVDA ), and others are duking it out for AI supremacy…
The real winner of the this race may be a ‘dark horse’ startup that most investors haven’t heard of yet…
One that’s backed by one of the richest men in the world, Elon Musk…
And we’ve found a backdoor way for you to invest in this promising startup that could shock the world over coming months and years.
Learn all about this powerful up-and-comer.

2024-04-13,Stocks I'm Buying The Third Week Of April,"Job gains in March mainly came from immigrants and part-time employment.
Real-time inflation is far lower than the CPI would lead you to believe and has been below the Fed's 2% target for the better part of a year.
I give my admittedly unpopular view on the green tech trade with China and the benefits of international trade.
The recent market correction has offered up numerous attractive investment opportunities for long-term dividend growth investors.
Grab a fork and spoon, tie your napkin round your neck, and scoot up to the table. Get ready for a feast of economic analysis and eminently buyable dividend stocks. I'll be your chef de cuisine.
There's simply no time for hors d'oeuvres. Let's get straight to it. Here's what's on the menu:
A quick update on the labor market after March's job gains.
Why inflation is not really ""running hot,"" ""stubbornly high,"" or ""sticky.""

2024-04-13,Chip Boom Champions: 3 Semiconductor Stocks to Quadruple Your Money,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The emergence of artificial intelligence stands as a force ready to transform several prominent industries. Investors looking to seize a rare chance to capitalize on these gains have aimed their efforts at leading semiconductor stocks to quadruple their money. Such a move clearly makes sense.
Demand for high-powered AI chips powering self-driving cars and medical diagnosis continues to soar. This growth isn’t hype — 2024 forecasts unprecedented market expansion. AI demands advanced chip structures for data handling and computations. These stocks enable investors to profit from AI’s explosive growth.
Semiconductors revolutionize modern life. Consider investing in semiconductor stocks in April as long-term bets. These are three of the top players in the sector that I don’t think get enough love. Accordingly, those looking for a more diversified chips portfolio should look at the stocks investors are looking at now.
Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. (TSM)
Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com
First off the list is the Asian semiconductor company Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM ). The company’s Q1 earnings were recently released, and these numbers impressed investors with Taiwan Semi’s excellent results.
TSMC stock surged as the company reported 16.5% sales growth on a year-over-year basis. The company’s March-quarter sales hit $18.86 billion, easily surpassing estimates of $18.26 billion. Previous-year sales were $16.62 billion, signaling strong growth over time. TSMC’s Q1 revenue rebounded after four quarters of decline. Clients include some of the most prominent names in this space, such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ).
Analyst Charles Shi maintained a buy rating for TSM stock, raising his price target to $168 from R133. He cited TSMC’s strength in AI and said that despite the impact of an earthquake , the company expects to meet its full-year growth target. Shi predicts a Q3 recovery, and I’m in line with this view.
The company also holds 50% of the contract chip manufacturing market to add to this thesis.  It dominates the highest-performing computing sector. Alongside AMD, Nvidia and Broadcom, TSMC also shares the success of AI chips as these companies rely on TSMC. With cutting-edge chip tech like 3nm and upcoming 2nm processes, TSMC drives AI innovation. Bullish forecasts predict over 20% revenue growth in FY24. Expanding with new plants in Germany and Japan, TSMC leads the AI revolution.
ASML Holding NV (ASML)
Source: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock
Predicted to have an upward trajectory until 2027, ASML (NASDAQ: ASML ) is a semiconductor stock every investor should have in their portfolio right now. Analysts predict a 25% rise to $1,215 per share by 2025. Progression suggests $1,500 in 2026 and nearly $1,900 by 2027, doubling the current value. ASML’s dominance in chip technology, especially EUV lithograph, which is crucial for AI, supports this potential growth.
Based in the Netherlands, the company revolutionizes semiconductor production for Intel and TSMC using EUV light , creating ultra-thin lines on silicon. Its lithography dominance, shielded by patents, faces challenges from espionage and trade disputes.
ASML’s future shines bright, particularly in lithography. Mordor Intelligence forecasts over 11% annual growth for EUV lithography through 2029. Demand for high-performance chips, essential for AI, fuels ASML’s prospects, with Taiwan Semiconductor as a critical client. Moreover, a Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ) analyst’s note highlights favorable risk/reward in ASML , driven by AI momentum.
Applied Materials (AMAT)
Source: michelmond / Shutterstock.com
Recently upgraded by analysts, Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT ) excels in semiconductor and display equipment, favored by JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM ) with a $260 price target. Strategic positioning and tech advancements, like HBM and GAA, position the company well for market share growth in a projected $110 billion market by 2025. Q1 results surpassed forecasts, underlining its market strength and strategic accuracy.
Cantor Fitzgerald also upgraded Applied Materials to overweight, raising their price target to $260 per share. Expectations of a strong semiconductor equipment market drove this shift. Applied Materials’ strategic position and tech advancements, including HBM and GAA transistors, fuel optimism for market share growth.
Applied Materials’ GAAP earnings were $2.41 per share, exceeding the non-GAAP $2.13. Despite a slight sales decline from Q1 2023, improved gross and operating margins led to a 19% year-over-year profit increase. Services segment profitability, notably, rose significantly, aiding overall profitability.

The trillions of dollars invested passively in index funds feed into all of the Mega Cap tech companies driving the A.I. machine, but very few investors own companies producing the metals necessary to compute, store and network data.
The supply of many metals is insufficient to meet future demand, and prices are too low to give an incentive for new development.
We believe prices must rise to levels that make development projects economical, and the companies that can deliver supply into that environment will benefit.

2024-04-12,XLK And The Return Of Irrational Exuberance,"Signs of irrational exuberance in the technology sector are becoming evident, with certain parts of the market trading significantly above trend.
The recently launched Destiny Tech100 closed-end fund is trading at around ten times net asset value, posing a risk for investors.
The XLK ETF has become excessively concentrated in a few names, with four companies representing more than half of the ETF's value.
We are increasingly seeing signs of irrational exuberance in the technology sector. Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict when the irrational behavior will end, or as John Maynard Keynes famously put it, ""markets can stay irrational for longer than you can stay solvent."" In any case, it is becoming clear that certain parts of the market are once again becoming a ""musical chairs"" game, where someone will be left holding the bag once valuations return to a reasonable level....",31
2024-04-12,"Apple Stock Has 20% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst","Growth concerns keep dogging Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) . The Cupertino colossus abandoned plans to build its electric car, iPhone sales in China are drying up, and Apple even seems to have missed the boat on artificial intelligence -- to the extent it's had to ask Google for help ). Share prices of Apple stock are down about $20 from recent highs hit in January.
But that's not necessarily bad news for new investors.
Up until recently, writes JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee, investors ""have ... been averse to the premium valuation"" of Apple stock. But now that Apple's share price is a bit less premium, investors may be willing to give it a second look -- and once they do, they may like what they see.",31
2024-04-12,Apple: Why I Sold All My Shares,"Recently I sold all my Apple shares at about $182.
I sold primarily because the stock had gotten extremely expensive, not because I believed that the company's fortunes had gotten worse.
Apple is facing challenges in China, and its Vision Pro reportedly hasn't sold enough units to move the needle for the company.
I'm not expecting Apple to reveal that it grew a lot in the first quarter.
For this reason, I'm not buying any shares, despite the fact that Apple is now slightly cheaper than it was when I sold.
I sold all of my Apple ( AAPL ) stock earlier this year. I had bought the stock in 2022, at prices between $130 and $150, with an average cost around $145. My opinion on the stock did not change between the time I bought it and the time I sold, but the stock got considerably more expensive. I sold the stock at $182–pretty close to today’s price....",31
2024-04-12,Price-to-Earnings Perfection: 3 Stocks With Ideal P/E Ratios,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Identifying stocks with ideal P/E ratios that offer consistency and stability can be important. On the one hand, underperforming or overvalued stocks may be cheap for a good reason. On the other hand, stocks that have been rising rapidly could be due for a correction.
Some stocks see wide fluctuations in their (price-to-earnings) P/E ratio, which could indicate that investors are reacting emotionally to that asset. For some traders, that type of movement may present opportunities, but for others, it signifies increased risk due to less predictable price behavior. A prudent strategy is to focus on stocks with P/E ratios that avoid the extremes and demonstrate stability.
Stocks with ideal P/E ratios offer promise. Of course, reasonable valuation metrics may vary depending on investment style. However, some companies are neither overvalued nor undervalued, trading at fair value. In an uptrending market, a balanced approach concentrating on stocks with ideal P/E ratios could help generate consistent gains with less stress versus trying to identify extreme movers.
Typically, stocks have an approximate P/E ratio of 20x, though the ratio depends on the industry . More important than the specific numeric ratio is the company’s financial performance. For a stock maintaining a stable P/E, rising earnings that track the stock price indicate the company is executing well operationally. After all, the P/E ratio is the division of the company’s stock price by its earnings. Solid fundamentals suggest the ability to continue delivering share price appreciation and dividend growth in line with profits.
Here are some stocks with ideal P/E ratios suitable for investors seeking stability and consistency:
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Moab Republic / Shutterstock
It should be no surprise that one of Warren Buffett’s preferred valued stocks would make the cut. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is one of the stocks with ideal P/E ratios that generate consecutive solid growth over time. It is currently trading at a P/E ratio of 26.3x , which is actually below the S&P 500 index.
While this may be slightly higher than the long-term average P/E ratio of 20x for most stocks, Apple has the advantage of being a well-established brand. More importantly, Apple has consistently grown its earnings for over a decade, and its brand retains investors’ confidence. This could help keep its share price aligned with earnings going forward, maintaining an ideal P/E ratio.
Coca-Cola (KO)
Source: phloxii / Shutterstock.com
Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ) is another one of the stocks with ideal P/E ratios. As a leading beverage company, Coca-Cola tends to experience stable growth as demand for its products remains consistent through different economic conditions.
While share price increases may be modest for KO, the company offers investors a relatively high dividend yield of 3.3% . Notably, The stock currently trades at a P/E ratio near the optimal stock average of 24x, making it one of the stocks with ideal P/E ratios. Analysis shows Coca-Cola’s P/E ratio has been consistently at or above this level since 2018. That year, earnings were impacted by a one-time tax impact of changes under the Trump administration.
JPMorgan Chase (JPM)
Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM ) is the final pick of stocks with ideal P/E ratios. It has built significant reserves in anticipation of a potential economic downturn predicted by its CEO last year. With the U.S. economy now appearing poised for a soft landing, the largest bank in the country has ample resources to reward shareholders through dividends and support its stock price.
Based on its upcoming quarterly earnings report, the company is also well-positioned to benefit from interest rate conditions . At a P/E ratio of 12.1x, JPM trades in line with the average for the U.S. banking sector of 11.8x. It represents one of the stocks with ideal P/E ratios , given its relatively consistent earnings growth over the past decade when profits have tripled . This could provide long-term holders stability through consistent growth.

The first quarter’s stock returns, much like the returns for all of 2023, far outpaced increases in earnings – both actual and projected.
Despite 2024 Wall Street stock euphoria, however, the bond market is signaling that it doesn’t quite agree with the Fed’s prediction of its own actions, particularly concerning future projections beyond this year.
Dear clients and fellow shareholders:
Over a period as short as a few months – or even a year – stock prices can be influenced by almost anything, including factors that are completely unrelated to the actual values of the underlying businesses. The 5-to-10% rise in the U.S. stock market during the first quarter was a pleasant reminder of that fact. (Our stock portfolio increased approximately 13% during the first quarter.

Artificial intelligence isn’t going anywhere. Bloomberg Intelligence forecasts that the generative AI market will grow to $1.3 trillion over the next 10 years from $40 billion in 2022. The technology promises to change all our lives in both small and big ways. The future is both exciting and a little intimidating when it comes to the brave new world of AI.
While most technology companies are racing ahead with AI technologies, some have set themselves apart from the pack. These are companies that are racing ahead with the technology and finding ways to quickly monetize it and boost their bottom lines. While analysts agree that we are in the early innings of the AI revolution, they clearly see winners emerging in the space . Here are three AI stocks to turn $10,000 into $1 million: April 2024.
Palantir Technologies (PLTR)

Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR ) is leveraging AI to bolster its data analytics service, and the results have been impressive. Largely because of its use of AI, PLTR stock has risen 167% over the last 12 months, including a 35% gain so far this year. The company’s stock jumped nearly 20% higher after the data analytics company’s most recent financial results were made public. Specifically, Palantir reported that its revenue increased 20% from a year earlier.
The growth at Palantir has been attributed to demand for AI, which the company’s CEO Alex Karp has repeatedly called “unrelenting.” To capitalize on the opportunity, Palantir is rolling out a new AI platform and making it available to both its government and commercial clients . Palantir has now reported four consecutive quarters of profitability, and rumors are growing that PLTR stock will be added to the benchmark S&P 500 index by year’s end.
Apple (AAPL)

Don’t sleep on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). The leading technology company has lagged behind in AI so far, but that could change quickly. The company is hosting its annual Worldwide Developers Conference from June 10 to 14 , and there is speculation the company will announce new AI products at the event. In February of this year, Apple CEO Tim Cook said Apple is “investing significantly” in AI and that there would be an AI announcement by the company this year.
More recently, there have been media reports that Apple is in talks with Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) about licensing Gemini AI technology for future editions of the iPhone. It has also been reported that Apple is developing robots for use in the home after canceling its electric vehicle project. Multiple media reports say that engineers at Apple are in the early stages of developing a robot that can follow users around their homes and perform basic tasks. This is all to say that Apple could emerge as a major AI player.

Meta Platforms (META)

Meta Platforms has pivoted aggressively from the metaverse to focus on AI. The company is working overtime to cascade AI across its social media platforms, virtual reality headsets, and other applications. As a result, Meta Platforms has become a huge buyer of AI microchips and semiconductors. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that the company could spend billions of dollars this year buying microchips from Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and others.
In a post on Instagram, Zuckerberg said the company will have 350,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) and about 600,000 H100 compute equivalent GPUs by the end of 2024. “Our long-term vision is to build general intelligence, open source it responsibly, and make it widely available so everyone can benefit,” wrote Zuckerberg on social media. Owing to its growing push into AI , META stock has been a huge gainer, rising 142% in the past 12 months, including a 50% increase so far in 2024.

The dip has some on Wall Street wondering aloud if we’re at or close to the market’s peak and now entering what could be a steep selloff. Many analysts say a pullback is overdue with all three major stock indices hitting all-time highs throughout the first quarter.
The S&P 500 gained more than 25% from the end of October through the end of March, which is quite a strong rally. Stocks in certain sectors rallied particularly hard, notably artificial intelligence ( AI ), semiconductors, cybersecurity, and weight-loss medications. But much of the rally was predicated on expectations for lower interest rates, the timing of which has been thrown into doubt with inflation remaining high and the economy showing resilience. Here are all-time high flyers: seven stocks to buy as the market peaks.
Stocks to Buy: Microsoft (MSFT)

Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) continues to assert its dominance in AI and its stock has been responding. In the last 12 months, MSFT stock has increased nearly 50% , including a 15% increase this year. The company and its stock continue to be viewed as one of the best ways to play the bull market in AI that is helping to push the stock market to record highs. Recently, Microsoft further expanded its global reach in AI, announcing an investment of $2.90 billion to enhance its AI business in Japan.
The money, which represents Microsoft’s biggest ever investment in Japan , will go towards the development of advanced AI semiconductors at two facilities in the Asian nation. Microsoft also plans to allocate funds towards an AI reskilling program in Japan that will see three million workers trained on the technology. And, the company plans to establish a new AI lab in Tokyo for research and development on robotics and machine learning. This is just the latest example of how Microsoft is staying ahead in the AI race.
Coinbase (COIN)

In addition to AI, another major catalyst for the market continues to be cryptocurrencies. And one of the best ways to play the boom in crypto is to own shares of Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN ). Shares of the cryptocurrency exchange have been white hot amid the rise in crypto prices. In the last 12 months, COIN stock has risen 277% . Already in 2024, the company’s share price has gained 60%. Despite the big rally, analysts see more upside ahead for Coinbase and its shareholders.
Analysts at Wall Street firm Oppenheimer (NYSE: OPY ) recently raised their price target on COIN stock to $276 from $200 and reiterated a “buy” rating on the shares. The price target is 11% higher than where Coinbase’s stock currently trades. In a research note, Oppenheimer said that Coinbase is likely to benefit from the long-term adoption of blockchain technology. The brokerage also raised its earning estimates for Coinbase.
The analyst upgrade comes as Coinbase announced that it has received regulatory approval to begin operating its cryptocurrency exchange in Canada. Coinbase, which is one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, has now become the biggest crypto trading platform north of the border.
Stocks to Buy: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM)

No corner of the market is hotter right now than semiconductor stocks . Microchips and semiconductors are viewed as the key to unlocking the potential of AI, fueling a huge rally. And among chip and semi stocks, one of the best to own is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE: TSM ), commonly known as TSMC. The Taiwanese company currently manufacturers more than half (50%) of all the microchips in the world, with some estimates putting its market share as high as 60% .
The dominance of TSMC when it comes to making microchips and semiconductors for third parties such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has pushed its share price sharply higher. Through 12 months, TSM stock is up 62% and currently trading near its all-time high. The company and stock just got a boost from news that the U.S. government is giving it $6.60 billion to help fund the construction of microchip fabrication plants in Arizona.
The government funding is coming from the U.S. CHIPS Act that aims to increase America’s chip security and lessen the country’s reliance on foreign made microchips and semiconductors. TSMC is spending about $65 billion to build three cutting-edge fabrication plants in Phoenix, Arizona. In announcing the funding, the U.S. government said that TSMC’s Arizona plants have already created more than 25,000 jobs and attracted 14 semiconductor suppliers to the southwestern state.
GE Aerospace (GE)

Now that General Electric has successfully divided itself into three publicly traded companies, it might be an opportune time to invest in GE Aerospace (NYSE: GE ), which retains the company’s original industrial business, including its aircraft engine manufacturing unit. Not only has GE stock doubled in the past 12 months as the company hived itself into three, but GE Aerospace just announced that it is raising its quarterly dividend payment to shareholders by an astounding 250%.
Going forward, GE Aerospace will pay a quarterly dividend of 28 cents per share, up from eight cents previously. Last fall, management outlined plans to return 75% of the company’s free cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and buybacks once the dust settled on the three-way split. GE Aerospace has said that it expects to generate more than $5 billion of free cash flow this year, which could lead to windfall for current and future shareholders. This makes GE Aerospace a stock to buy as the market peaks.
Stocks to Buy: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
Now for a buy-the-dip candidate. Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ) has seen its stock decline 5% so far in 2024. Through 12 months, the company’s share price is down 7%. Now might be the time to buy JNJ stock as the company continues to grow through an acquisition strategy. Johnson & Johnson has just announced that it is buying Shockwave Medical (NASDAQ: SWAV ) for $13.10 billion as it grows its treatments for heart disease and other pulmonary ailments.
The purchase of Shockwave Medical is the largest by Johnson & Johnson since its $16.60 billion acquisition of heart pump maker Abiomed in 2022. Shockwave Medical specializes in medical devices that use shockwaves to break down calcified plaque in heart vessels. It’s a process that is similar to how kidney stones are broken apart and removed. Under terms of the deal, Johnson & Johnson has agreed to pay $335 per share in cash to acquire Shockwave Medical. The acquisition is expected to close this summer.
United Parcel Service (UPS)

Another stock that looks like a deal at current levels is United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS ). The company’s stock is also down 5% this year and looks cheap right now trading at 19 times future earnings estimates and with a quarterly dividend that yields 4.34%. Like the other names on this list, goods things are happening at United Parcel Service with catalysts that are likely to send UPS stock higher in the coming months.
Specifically, United Parcel Service has just struck a deal to become the primary air cargo provider for the U.S. Postal Service, replacing archrival Federal Express (NYSE: FDX ). FedEx previously had the air cargo contract with the U.S. Postal Service for 22 years and earned $1.73 billion from it in 2023. The contract with the U.S. Postal Service now switches to United Parcel Service in September of this year and will give its earnings a boost going forward. UPS stock has declined 21% over the last year.
Novo Nordisk (NVO)

In healthcare, nothing is working right now quite as well as weight-loss drugs. And Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO ) is leading in this area with its in-demand medications Ozempic and Wegovy . Sales of the weight-loss drugs are rising fast, sending NVO stock higher as a result. Over the past 12 months, Novo Nordisk’s share price has gained 57%, including a 22% increase so far in 2024. The growth has made Novo Nordisk one of Europe’s largest publicly traded companies with a market capitalization of nearly half a trillion dollars.
Even with the growth from the weight-loss drugs, the Danish pharmaceutical giant isn’t sitting idle. Novo Nordisk has announced that it is buying privately held Cardior Pharmaceuticals for $1.10 billion. The acquisition strengthens Novo Nordisk’s pipeline of cardiovascular medications. The company has said that it is expanding its diabetes and weight-loss drugs to also include cardiovascular and heart treatments.
The acquisition includes Cardior Pharmaceuticals’ lead compound CDR132L that is in Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of heart failure. The purchase of Cardior is expected to close in the current second quarter.

The global AI Race has begun, and it’s off to a red-hot start. Companies like Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ) and Apple ( AAPL ) – among countless others – are all pouring billions of dollars into this groundbreaking tech.
Why? Because they know that the winner of the AI Race will inevitably become the world’s most powerful company.
But funnily enough, the ultimate winner may not be any of those Big Tech companies.
Rather, it may be a company that you’ve likely never heard of before…
I’m talking about xAI, Elon Musk’s newest AI startup.
A New AI Frontrunner?
About a year ago, Elon Musk set out to create his own AI startup, xAI. He felt that his competitors were all missing the ultimate goal of creating powerful and fair AI. Now, just over a year later, that startup is working to raise $3 billion at an $18 billion valuation.
That is huge growth for a company in just under a year.
But xAI’s growth story could just be getting started.
After all, Apple didn’t become Apple because of the iPhone. It became Apple because of Steve Jobs.
Microsoft didn’t become Microsoft because of Windows. It became Microsoft because of Bill Gates.
World-changing people create world-changing businesses.
So… if you want to invest in world-changing businesses… start by investing in world-changing people.
We certainly believe that Elon Musk is a world-changer.
He co-founded PayPal ( PYPL ), the world’s largest digital payment platform, now worth more than $70 billion…
And SpaceX , the world’s largest private space rocket firm, now worth $180 billion.
He pioneered the world’s largest automaker in Tesla ( TSLA ), which is now worth more than all of the next 10 biggest automakers combined…
And he’s also the man behind Neuralink , The Boring Company , and X .
Musk has influenced how we pay for things, what cars we drive, how we communicate online, how we see space…
I’d venture to say that he is one of the most influential business figures of the past 20 years.
A great example of world-changing.
The Final Word
And now this world-changing person has turned his focus to a new business venture at the heart of possibly the most transformative technology the world has ever seen: AI.
Would you bet against him here?
I don’t think I would.
xAI has already launched an impressive AI chatbot named Grok, which many experts claim stacks up pound-for-pound against ChatGPT. And as we mentioned above, the firm is already in talks to raise $3 billion at an $18 billion valuation.
This latest startup is moving fast. With impressive progress. And the journey is likely just getting started.
Because xAI could be Musk’s biggest venture yet.
And right now, you have an opportunity to invest in it.
Now, not directly, of course – xAI is barely a year old. It is still a private startup.
But we have found a potentially huge “backdoor” investment opportunity into xAI. It’s a stock that you’ve likely have never heard of before, but we think it could be xAI’s leading tech component supplier.
If xAI becomes a champion of the multi-trillion-dollar AI race, then this stock could absolutely soar.
Get all the details about this little-known supplier.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) stock is on the move Thursday after the graphics card company’s shares got an increased price target from Raymond James.
This saw the firm’s analysts increase their price target for NVDA stock from $850 per share to $1,100 per share . That’s a potential upside of 26.4% compared to its prior closing price. It’s also above the analyst consensus price prediction of $926.30 per share.

What’s Behind the Bull Stance on NVDA Stock?
Here’s what the Raymond James analysts had to say about Nvidia in a note to clients obtained by Seeking Alpha :
“We believe concerns regarding a potential pause in customer spending ahead of Blackwell ramps are unwarranted as Inferencing demand continues to outpace GPU supply […] We expect H200 to be a key near-term driver followed by B100 / B200 ramps in 2H24. Our recent conversations in Asia point to a significant mix shift in favor of GB200 NVL systems, which positions NVDA to capture additional share of [data center] capex.”

2024-04-11,Apple Spyware Warning: What to Know About 'Mercenary Spyware Attack' Alerts,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
A massive Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) spyware warning has the company alerting owners of its products about a “mercenary spyware attack.”
The latest spyware warning from Apple focused on iPhone owners in India and 91 other countries. It alerted them to a spyware that was attempting to install itself on their devices.
The spyware warning has Apple claiming the following in emails sent to users, as reported by Forbes :
“Apple detected that you are being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack that is trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID […] This attack is likely targeting you specifically because of who you are or what you do. Although it’s never possible to achieve absolute certainty when detecting such attacks, Apple has high confidence in this warning—please take it seriously.”
Who Is Behind the Apple Spyware Warning?
It’s unknown who exactly is behind the malware that triggered this latest spyware warning. However, it could be state actors, as Apple has run into trouble with this in the past. This means the attack is likely targeting the types of individuals that governments would want to keep an eye on.
In fact, the tech company has sent similar warnings out to customers in more than 150 countries over the last three years. That includes mercenary spyware attacks targeting customers in India in October. That was tied back to Israeli spyware maker NSO Group .
AAPL stock is up slightly as of Thursday morning despite the spyware news.

2024-04-11,Why You Should Wait for Some Dip Before Biting Into Apple Stock,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
In the 16 months since ChatGPT was introduced three truths have been proven in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). Broadly, this has meant short-term pain for Apple stock (NASDAQ: AAPL ).
First, the Cloud needs to be upgraded. Second, consumer applications will take time to develop. Third, consumers will need new clients to take advantage of them.
Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has blown by it and now leads in market cap by $500 billion, roughly the market cap of Tesla (NASDAQ: MSFT ). Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) has closed the gap in third to the same amount.
When do you buy the dip?
Why Apple Fell
Apple’s main AI move so far has been cozying up to Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) on its Gemini AI tool. This makes sense. Apple let Google take the lead in search, AI research is expensive, and it’s vital that Alphabet be competitive there. Apple stock is licensing Shutterstock images to train its AI models, so it’s not completely dependent on Gemini.
But that won’t sell new iPhones.  The latest rumors point to a new SE model early next year featuring the best of the last two models, at a low price. That should lead to lots of upgrades, but not the revenue boost Apple needs to keep Wall Street happy.
By ending its work in self-driving cars , Apple is also pointing to a new austerity .
Early reports on the Apple Vision Pro make it look like Apple’s CyberTruck. It’s appealing an adverse decision banning some versions of the Apple Watch, and it’s on the defensive over its huge cut of app store subscription fees.
Making Apple Pie
Once GenAI is perfected, Apple is a guaranteed winner.
That’s because AI is a story of two revolutions, in queries and interfaces. Most attention today is focused on queries. This has strengthened Microsoft . But it will also change how we interface with computing. That’s where Siri, the Watch, and Apple Vision Pro will make their money.
Administration grants to Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM ) for its Arizona fabrication plants are all about assuring Apple a bigger supply of chips .
AI models will need access to advanced clients and their interfaces to work. That means you’ll need a new iPhone, a new Watch, and probably a new laptop to get the most from new services.
We think of Apple as a products company, but it’s also, now, a semiconductor outfit. New hardware will require both Central Processing Units (CPUs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) compatible with Nvidia output. Apple is making both.
It’s all part of improving profits within Apple’s supply chain, just as it takes all it can from its distribution channel. It’s a strategy now used by everyone from Lululemon (NASDAQ: LULU ) in clothing to Target (NYSE: TGT ) in food and furnishings. It requires enormous capital expenses to execute, but the result shows on the bottom line.
Apple grew its gross margins, and operating cash flow, last year through these controls. For the December quarter it doubled the amount of cash it had on hand, year-over-year.
The Bottom Line
A decade ago, then-Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst compared the cloud to the standardized nuts and bolts that made the modern world possible. They appeared 60 years into the industrial revolution, much as cloud appeared 60 years into computing.
AI will need the equivalent of mental bridges to prove its value, and that’s what Apple stock is building in its full device line-up.
You don’t have to rush back into Apple. If you’re focused on the current quarter, or even the next two quarters, you can do better.
But for those with a longer-term time horizon, this is the time to start accumulating. You buy on weakness and sell into strength. Apple stock is weak right now.
It won’t stay weak.  Before the decade’s end it will be number one again.

2024-04-10,Inflation Panic Creates a Great Buying Opportunity in Stocks,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Uh oh! The latest Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) report showed that inflation ran hotter than expected in March and actually rose from February. After falling throughout most of 2023, the U.S. inflation rate has now risen for two months in a row.
Inflation is making a comeback.
And stocks are crashing in response.
Time to dump stocks and head for the hills?
Hardly. On the contrary, thanks to investors’ knee-jerk reaction, this is a golden buying opportunity.
That’s because this little inflation “setback” is just a temporary blip. We’re confident it will end next month. And when it does, stocks should really blast off.
This is the time to buy the dip.
Why Inflation Will Keep Falling Again Soon
Throughout the second half of 2022 and nearly all of 2023, the U.S. inflation rate slid from 9% to 3% pretty consistently.
That trend has changed course in 2024. In January, CPI clocked in at 3.1%. It rose to 3.2% in February, then 3.5% in March.
This sudden “reinflation” is spooking investors. Some pundits are calling for inflation to heat back up to 5%-plus in the coming months.
But we’re confident that’s not going to happen.
Instead, we expect March to be the last month of “reinflation.” Starting this month, inflation will likely start falling again.
The reinflation we’ve seen over the past two months has been driven mostly by the Fed’s dovish December pivot in policy, when it forecasted three rate cuts in 2024. That sent yields crashing, which supported more economic demand across the country through more spending, more investment, etc.
Now the Federal Reserve is walking back those rate-cut projections. And after today’s report, it’ll likely embrace a fully hawkish stance. Yields have already surged over the past few weeks and could continue to. This dynamic will choke off economic demand across the country through less spending, less investment, etc.
And that will, of course, lead to lower inflation rates.
The Likely Inflation Trajectory
Indeed, the Cleveland Fed’s Nowcasting model calls for inflation to drop to 3.4% in April from 3.5% in March, which will end the recent streak of reinflation.
What does that mean for stocks?
They’ll start rising again very soon.
For the past two years, stocks and inflation have been nearly perfectly inversely correlated. When inflation rises, stocks fall. When it falls, stocks rise. Just consider:
Throughout the first half of 2022, inflation roared higher while stocks crashed. From summer 2022 to summer 2023, inflation crashed while stocks roared higher. In the fall of 2023, inflation pushed higher while stocks dropped. And in the winter of 2023, inflation started falling again while stocks rallied.
Now here in early 2024, stocks are struggling as inflation reheats. No surprise there.
So, with inflation set to resume its decline shortly, it should come as no surprise that stocks will resume their rally, too.
This isn’t time to run for the hills. It’s time to buy the dip.
And we have the perfect set of stocks to take advantage of this buying opportunity.
The Final Word
The AI Race is heating up. Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Alphabet ( GOOGL ), Meta ( META ), and Apple ( AAPL ) are all investing billions of dollars to create the best AI programs in the world.
But we think the “dark horse” in this race is Elon Musk’s new AI startup, xAI . It’s currently in talks to raise $3 billion at an $18 billion valuation – and the company was founded just a year ago.
From zero to $18 billion… in just a year – it appears something special is happening over at xAI.
And for a variety of reasons, we think xAI could emerge as one of the leaders in the AI Race.
Though of course, xAI isn’t public. It’s a private startup. But for investors interested in betting on the firm’s enormous growth potential over the next few years, we’ve found the perfect stock to play it.
Our research suggests this company could very well be xAI’s top AI components supplier.

They are also worried that Apple's lack of a homegrown artificial intelligence product could seriously damage Apple's share price this year. Together those worries go some way to explaining why share prices of the iPhone maker are down about 13% since the start of 2024.

2024-04-10,Robot Overlords: 3 AI Stocks to Own Before the Machine Uprising,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
It seems like you can’t get very far these days without hearing or seeing the word AI. Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has seen explosive growth as of late. Its evolution has currently brought up many concerns about its speed of expansion and the potential elimination of much of the world’s labor force. Although many have called it the AI bubble for stocks, there is good reason to believe that this technology will truly change the world forever.
Many of the world’s smartest minds have called AI the next big technology and a moment akin to the introduction of the internet. So as investors, how can we take advantage of this technological revolution? Hey, we might all be doomed anyway once the machine uprising takes place. Until then, here are three AI stocks to own in every growth portfolio.
Tesla (TSLA)
Source: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.com
Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) is an American multinational electric vehicle maker and energy company. TSLA is easily one of the most polarizing stocks on the market. This is evident in the wide range of analyst price targets which range from $24.00 to $320.00 per share. The average price target is $190.34, about 15% higher than the current price.
If you believe that Tesla is a tech company, then you will be excited by its AI prospects. Tesla is preparing to release its Optimius humanoid robot sometime around 2026. The company also continues to release new versions of its FSD technology for self-driving cars. Finally, CEO Elon Musk announced that its robo-taxis will be unveiled later this year in August. Tesla could be an AI leader when all is said and done.
Tesla often gets criticized for its high price multiples. Even after losing 33% in 2024, the stock still trades at 54x forward earnings. Nonetheless, on a brighter note, TSLA is now trading at just below six times its sales. If you’re bullish, you’ll like that Tesla is trading at close to its cheapest valuations ever, even without the realization of its AI products yet.
Microsoft (MSFT)
Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com
After overtaking Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) earlier this year, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) now sits as the largest company in the world by market capitalization. Yet, even after hitting a market cap of nearly $3.2 trillion, the stock is still trading relatively fairly compared to its analyst high price target of about $507.
Early on in the AI race, Microsoft made the biggest splash by taking a 10% stake in GPT creator OpenAI. This stake can be as high as 49% depending on how OpenAI performs. Microsoft was quick to integrate OpenAI capabilities into many of Microsoft’s products and services. With more than 72% of the world’s computers using Windows, Microsoft has taken a clear lead in the AI software sector.
Compared to other Magnificient 7 stocks, Microsoft trades at quite a premium. MSFT currently trades at nearly 32x forward earnings and nearly 14x sales. Given how wide of a moat Microsoft has and how large its market share of operating systems is, these premiums shouldn’t bother any Microsoft bulls who hold the stock for the long term.
Lemonade (LMND)
Source: Stephanie L Sanchez / Shutterstock.com
Lemonade (NYSE: LMND ) is an American insurance technology company that was founded in 2015. Its average price target sits at $19.25 , about 14% higher than the current price.
This innovative company caught on during the pandemic when in-person services were widely reduced. Lemonade allowed customers to shop around and apply for insurance applicable to renters, homeowners, pets, auto and life. The company processes more than half its insurance claims by using AI via complex algorithms. By keeping much of the manual labor and human emotion out of the process, Lemonade’s AI advancements have allowed it to offer cheaper rates and a higher approval rate.
While Lemonade is not yet a profitable company, it has consistently grown its revenue. Over the past five years, revenue has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50%. Even still, the stock only trades at 2.7x sales which likely means the stock price has some catching up to do if revenue continues to grow at its recent pace.

However, one of its largest and most iconic components hasn't had the same success. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has gone in the opposite direction, down nearly 12% in 2024.

If you've been following Apple for a while, it's clear it hasn't been doing well. In the first quarter of fiscal-year 2024 (ending Dec. 30, 2023), its revenue rose only 2%.

2024-04-09,The Bull Run In Nvidia Stock Has Only Just Begun. Here's Why.,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
After a big run to start the year, Nvidia’s (NASDAQ: NVDA ) stock looks to have stalled. But don’t worry. It likely won’t be long before the rally in the chipmaker continues.
In the last month, NVDA stock has dipped 5%. The stock has struggled to rise above $950 per share and has retreated each time it hits that level. However, the current pullback comes after Nvidia had a huge run in January and February. Year to date, the stock is up 83% and a leader in the S&P 500 index. The current dip is likely only a temporary breather before NVDA stock again runs flat out. As such, investors would be smart to buy the dip.
Blockbuster Earnings
The rally in Nvidia’s stock that began in earnest at the start of 2023 has pushed the company to some important milestones. Earlier this year, Nvidia’s market capitalization crossed the $2 trillion mark and it is now the third largest publicly traded company in the world after Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). The company’s influence on the market is growing and the main catalyst for NVDA stock continues to be the company’s earnings.
Since last summer, the stock market literally pauses in the days ahead of Nvidia’s earnings reports. It’s as if investors and traders are holding their collective breath to see if the company can exceed the lofty expectations that have been set for it. So far, Nvidia hasn’t disappointed and the entire market rallies after the company beats Wall Street’s forecasts. In February, Nvidia reported earnings that covered the final quarter of 2023 that crushed expectations and showed mind boggling growth at the microchip and semiconductor maker.
Fueled by unrelenting demand for its microchips and semiconductors among artificial intelligence ( AI ) companies around the world, Nvidia reported that its Q4 2023 sales rose 265% year over year, while its profits grew 769% from a year earlier. All metrics topped analysts’ estimates, and the guidance provided was even better. For the just completed first quarter of the year, Nvidia has forecast sales of $24 billion. If achieved, that would be up 234% from sales of $7.19 billion a year earlier. Can Nvidia do it again? There’s no reason to doubt the company at this point.
Keeping Pace
The big question concerning Nvidia on Wall Street is how long can the company continue to exceed the sky high expectations that have been set for it? After all, the comparables the company faces are only getting tougher. At some point, Nvidia will fail to jump the bar that’s been set for its earnings and the stock will crash, right? Maybe not. Nvidia is continuing to pull out all the stops to stay ahead of its competitors and ensure that its earnings run at a blistering pace.
In March, Nvidia unveiled its next generation AI microchips at a developer conference. Called the Blackwell series , the first of these new chips, the GB200, is the company’s most powerful technology to date. Specifically, the new GB200 chip includes what Nvidia calls a “transformer engine” that’s designed to run transformer based AI, one of the core technologies underpinning chatbots such as GPT-4. Nvidia is already receiving huge pre-orders from companies such as Microsoft and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ).
At the same time, Nvidia has signalled its intention to become less of a microchip provider and more of a platform provider going forward. To that end, the company introduced new revenue-generating software called Nvidia Inference Microservice (NIM) that it will charge a subscription fee for enterprise customers to access. And, Nvidia continues to expand globally, recently announcing plans to build a $200 million AI center in Indonesia as it grows throughout Asia.
Buy NVDA Stock
Nvidia currently controls about three-quarters (75%) of the AI chip market worldwide. That dominance shows no signs of decreasing. If anything, Nvidia’s market share is likely to increase as it begins to deliver its Blackwell series of microchips later this year. While the company’s earnings and stock have produced blockbuster gains over the last 18 months, there’s every reason to believe that the growth will continue. The bottom line is that Nvidia has the expertise and the products to remain the foundation of the AI revolution. For this reason, NVDA stock is a buy .

2024-04-09,Careful! Apple Stock Could Tumble as the Tech Giant Stumbles.,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
If you’re investing under the assumption that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is infallible and invincible, think again. As the company shows cracks in the armor, AAPL stock gets a “D” grade and we’re not giving it a confident recommendation today.
We’ve already pointed out some problems with the seemingly almighty Apple. For example, iPhone shipments fell by approximately 33% year over year in February. In the first six weeks of 2024, iPhone sales declined 24% YOY. Stick around, as there’s more evidence that, so far, Apple is having a less-than-stellar year.
Apple Resorts to Layoffs
As of April 5, AAPL stock was down 8.65% year to date. That’s definitely not a magnificent performance for a Magnificent Seven stock.
It’s a sign that everything isn’t necessarily going well with Apple. And here’s another sign: Apple is now resorting to layoffs.
Remember, Apple CEO Tim Cook previously declared that mass layoffs would be a “ last resort .” Yet, here we are and Apple is laying off 614 employees in California.
Apparently, this unfortunate news came after Apple gave up on Project Titan, the company’s attempt to build an electric vehicle. Nearly 2,000 employees were working on that project, so don’t be surprised if more workers are let go at some point.
Apple’s Personal-Robotics Endeavor Could Be a Major Failure
It might feel strange to witness Apple failing at something. Yet, we have to be forthright and acknowledge that Project Titan was a titanic failure that will cost some people their jobs.
You’d think Apple’s management would learn their lesson from this unfortunate experience. You might also think that Apple would stick to its core businesses, such as selling smartphones, for a while.
Yet, very soon after Project Titan’s failure, Apple is jumping headfirst into personal robotics , of all things. Reportedly, Apple is developing robots to follow people around in their homes, in hopes that this will be the “next big thing.”
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives is highly skeptical of Apple’s new personal-robotics endeavor. He contends that Apple should focus on artificial intelligence as CEO Tim Cook’s “legacy is going to be AI.”
Ives argues that Apple’s foray into household robots would be a “black-eye moment” and a “horror show” for the company.
AAPL Stock Could Stay Under Pressure for a While
As Apple scraps Project Titan and starts laying off workers, it’s clear that the company isn’t invincible. Plus, it’s risky for Apple to jump into the personal-robotics field. As Ives suggests, Apple really ought to devote its capital and effort to AI rather than to household robots.
Overall, it looks like Apple is going through a rough patch. Until there are clear indications that the rough patch is finished, it’s hard to be confident about AAPL stock. So, we’re assigning a “D” grade to the stock and investors can choose to stay on the sidelines for now.

It has entered into a correction and the worse could happen ahead of the first quarter earnings scheduled for May 2nd.
Apple woes are rising
Apple’s share price has crashed hard, making it the second-worst-performing Magnificent 7 company after Tesla, which has plunged by over 30% this year.
The company is facing a mountain of challenges, leading investors to question its next important catalyst. It has abandoned the Apple car project after spending billions of dollars in Research and Development (R&D).
Apple is facing a mountain of legal issues in the United States and Europe. In the US, the company is being sued for being a monopoly. I disagree with these claims since Apple faces substantial competition from Android phones.
Most importantly, its sales growth has crashed hard in the past few years because people are no longer upgrading their iPhones as they did in the past. Its annual revenue retreated from $394 billion in 2022 to $383 billion in 2023. iPhone sales have been in a downward trend.
At the same time, Apple’s services business is not growing as it did in the past. Besides, most people have already decided on whether they will use its services like Apple Music and Apple TV or not.
The next important catalyst for the Apple stock price will be the upcoming earnings, which will provide more insights about the Vision Pro product. These will be the first full quarter earnings since the product was launched.
Analysts are not excited about Apple’s earnings. The average estimate is that the company’s revenue came in at $83 billion in Q1, a 4.5% decline from the same period in 2023. For the year, analysts see the total revenue rising by just 1%.
Apple’s shares have no real catalyst going forward. iPhone sales have retreated while demand for the iPad has dropped. I don’t know many people who are buying brand-new iPads these days. And those who do, they are spending more years with them. iPad sales crashed to $7.1 billion in Q4.
Apple’s computers are still the best in the game but their sales growth is still not strong. For one, most people with Apple laptops and desktops stay for longer with them.
Apple stock price forecast
AAPL chart by TradingView
The daily chart shows that the AAPL share price formed a death cross on March 5th. This pattern happened when the 50-day and 200-day Weighted Moving Averages (WMA) made a bearish crossover. It has now remained below the two averages since then.
Now, the price sits at the crucial support at $183.40, which is notable since it failed to break below it in March.
A move below this level will point to more downside, with the next support level being at $165.30, the lowest swing on October 26th. This price was the neckline of the double-top pattern at $197.50. If this happens, it could drop to $150 by the next earnings.

Here are three that I think are equipped for a magnificent rest of 2024.
Meta Platforms (META)

Meta Platforms is showing no signs of losing its luster. The stock has added more than 52% in year-to-date gains to its impressive past-year surge. Even at new highs of $527 and change, I still find META stock incredibly cheap relative to its AI- and metaverse-powered growth prospects.
At writing, shares of Meta Platforms trade at 26.3 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), not fitting my definition of an expensive stock, especially for a firm leveraging generative AI more effectively than most in its industry.
Looking ahead, AI could easily continue paving the way for new highs. As more people purchase their first virtual reality headsets, perhaps Meta’s metaverse may begin to be seen as a source of strength rather than an expense builder. In any case, I wouldn’t give up on the stock here. It’s still cheap at new highs, in my books.
Apple (AAPL)

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is one of the Magnificent Seven companies that some critics may think should be removed from the group. I’m not one of them. The company is still innovating, perhaps at a much faster pace than investors believe.
As Apple Vision Pro launches into new markets later this year, while the firm looks to finally reveal some of the finer details of its AI ambitions, perhaps it’s too soon to shed your portfolio of AAPL stock. A recent Bloomberg report suggested that Apple is looking into creating home robots after ditching its Apple Car plans.
That’s an intriguing report, but not everybody’s convinced by the potential of robots to fuel growth for the tech giant. Dan Ives of Wedbush stated such a move would be a “black eye moment” for Apple. Harsh words. But I think he’s right in that Apple should be emphasizing AI more than experimenting with new hardware concepts.
Tesla (TSLA)

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) stock was the first out of the Magnificent Seven group. But whether it can work its way back in is another question entirely. I think it can, especially as Elon Musk looks to prove to the world that Tesla is not just an automobile company but a tech company on the cusp of disrupting big markets with its innovations.
Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood is a Tesla believer, having picked up TSLA stock numerous times in recent months. A robotaxi event scheduled for August 8 will be a pivotal moment for Musk and the future of his electric vehicle (EV) empire as it looks to reverse course after a horrid past two years.
Now down 60%, I have to say shares seem a tad too oversold, especially for those who believe that Tesla has a front-row seat to the full self-driving revolution. In short, Tesla isn’t magnificent right now. But come August, I think it could prove its doubters wrong.

Macroeconomic headwinds caught up with the company last year, leading to four consecutive quarters of revenue declines.

2024-04-07,"3 Low-Beta, High-Reward Stocks That Have More Room to Run","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
You don’t have to be a daredevil to score big gains in the stock market. Sure, high-risk, high-reward plays can supercharge your portfolio if you nail the timing just right on these plays. But for investors who prefer to keep their blood pressure in check, there’s an underrated strategy that lets you have your cake and eat it too.
I’m talking about buying into low-beta, high-reward stocks. These companies are essentially the best of both worlds. They provide plenty of long-term upside potential, but also are limited in terms of their downside risk. With low-beta stocks, the heavy lifting is already done by the company’s solid fundamentals. You can kick back and let compounding work its magic year after year.
Of course, you’ll still want to keep some truly low-risk ballast like bonds or cash in your portfolio for balance. But why resign yourself to low single-digit returns across the board? By sprinkling in a few of these low-beta growth darlings, you can have your portfolio deliver much higher returns over the long-run.
Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B)
Source: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com
Frankly, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A , NYSE: BRK-B ) is one of the most obvious picks if you’re hunting for a compounder with muted downside risk compared to the broader market, alongside the potential to deliver market-thumping returns over the long-haul. This conglomerate has both an impeccable reputation and a stellar historical track record of execution. These are two essential ingredients for keeping a stock afloat during periods of turbulence, while allowing a given stock to soar when tailwinds are blowing.
What’s not to love about Berkshire? The company has the flexibility to nimbly reallocate capital as trends and opportunities shift. Rigid index funds lack that maneuverability. Moreover, Berkshire is invested in a bevy of stalwart blue chips with incredible staying power – companies that will still be thriving decades from now.
Its largest holding, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), has admittedly come under fire recently for missing the AI train. But recent leaks point to the tech titan working on a robust on-device AI solution for Siri that could deliver solid performance. And let’s not forget that Apple continues to beat Wall Street’s expectations and remains a fan favorite among Gen Z. The company’s hardware products, which include iPhones and Macs continues to see impressive growth. And Apple’s software ecosystem is still gaining market share hand over fist.
But Apple is just the tip of the iceberg for Berkshire’s portfolio. The company also owns BNSF Railway , a railroad operator that would command a king’s ransom if it were a publicly-traded entity on its own. With such an incredible mix of cash-gushing businesses powered by the investment prowess of the Oracle of Omaha himself, it’s no wonder Berkshire has so consistently beaten the market.
O’Reilly (ORLY)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
O’Reilly (NASDAQ: ORLY ) is an automotive parts retailer, and I’ve been pounding the table on the auto parts sector for a while now. Why? Well, the civilian vehicle fleet has been aging at a rapid clip. The average car on the road is already a staggering 13.7 years old in 2024, and that number will likely only continue climbing.
High interest rates are dissuading consumers from making big-ticket purchases that come with hefty monthly payments. That dynamic bodes very well for companies like O’Reilly, since folks are more inclined to repair and maintain their existing vehicles rather than buy new ones.
O’Reilly’s financials back up this bullish thesis too. Analysts see O’Reilly’s earnings per share rocketing from around $42 in 2024 to $111 by 2033 . Revenues are projected to swell from $17 billion to $27 billion over that same stretch. With growth like that, I’d argue the stock has a lot more gas left in the tank to continue delivering stellar market-beating returns.
Don’t just take my word for it though. O’Reilly has an impressive historical track record, having compounded shareholder wealth by 179% over the past five years. For a mature company operating in the decidedly un-sexy auto parts sector, that’s an astounding feat.
Brown & Brown (BRO)
Source: MIND AND I / Shutterstock.com
Brown & Brown (NYSE: BRO ) is an insurance broker experiencing robust growth thanks to a potent one-two punch of rising rates and an aggressive acquisition strategy. On the pricing front, the company has been able to capitalize on firming insurance premiums. That has been a boon for its business, since Brown & Brown receives commissions based on the policies its clients purchase.
Plus, Brown & Brown has been actively strengthening its core business and expanding its international footprint through strategic M&A. The company’s acquisitions have allowed it to widen its moat and provide more services to its clientele base consisting mainly of small businesses.
A recent peek under the hood reveals just how well this growth strategy is paying off. Brown & Brown’s organic revenue growth remains in the double-digits . Meanwhile, the company’s balance sheet is solid, with ample capital to fuel future growth.
Brown & Brown’s revenues tend to be remarkably steady, since clients need to maintain coverage through thick and thin. That quality makes it one of the low-beta, high-reward stocks that can garner market-beating returns.

2024-04-06,The Apple Antitrust Fallout: 3 Stocks Poised to Capitalize on the Chaos,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
2024 is shaping up to be a tumultuous year for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). The tech behemoth and smartphone market leaders had been forced to contend with stock price downgrades from banks following lower consumer demand, and now face a landmark lawsuit amid accusations of building an industry monopoly.
Apple has firmly denied the allegations , but this has failed to stop comparisons being drawn between the firm and Microsoft’s (NASDAQ: MSFT ) behavior in the 1990s, which resulted in a lawsuit and requirements that the company modify its more monopolistic practices.
On Wall Street, there’s already been some damage done to Apple’s stock price. The first quarter of 2024 saw AAPL tumble more than 8%, and the prospect of a costly reprimand could bring a fundamental change in the way that Apple operates which opens the door to stronger smartphone market competition.
While the outcome of the lawsuit could hit Apple’s pockets, fundamental shifts in business operations could carry major ramifications for its market dominance. Should Apple be forced to make products more interoperable with other brands and provide more open services, consumers may be free to mix and match brands on an unprecedented scale. This may open the door to the following key smartphone stocks to grow into Apple’s market share:
Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG)
Unlike Apple, Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ,NASDAQ: GOOG ) has gotten off to a strong start in 2024, posting growth of around 10% in the first quarter.
Back in Q4 2023, Alphabet reported its fastest quarter for revenue growth since early 2022, with sales accelerating 13% from $76.05 billion year-over-year. Despite this impressive expectation-beating performance, share prices briefly slipped due to weaker Google ad revenue.
Recently, Alphabet’s stock rallied after reports suggested Google may be readying to put its artificial intelligence ( AI ) search services behind a paywall . Crucially, AI has been an area where Google has been quick to adopt while Apple’s interest in the emerging technology remained more hesitant.
Not only could this offer a crucial fresh revenue stream for Alphabet, but it could also see AI services become a key feature of Google’s next generation of Pixel smartphones, which are readying for launch later this year.
With Android as the closest rival of Apple’s iOS smartphone operating system, any challenges to the latter’s attempted smartphone industry monopoly will see Google’s market position improve. Additionally, should Apple be ordered to create cross-functionality throughout its range of smartphone products, we could see a surge in demand for Android products among iPhone users.
Samsung Electronics (SSNLF)
Source: JPstock / Shutterstock.com
Another stock that outperformed Apple in Q1 2024 and could benefit from a de-monopolization of the smartphone market is South Korean firm Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ).
While Samsung experienced slow growth throughout the opening weeks of the year, the recent news that the tech giant could be in line to become a supplier to semiconductor leaders Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) saw a rapid 5% jump in stock value . Currently, Nvidia is testing Samsung’s new range of high-bandwidth memory ( HBM ) chips in what may be a lucrative partnership.
Samsung’s advantageous position in the global chip market recovery has seen the firm’s stock price grow of late, and many securities firms are forecasting an operating profit of over 5 trillion won ($3.7 billion) in Q1 2024, up significantly from the 640 billion won ($476 million) recorded one year prior.
If these figures are achieved, they would represent Samsung’s largest operating profit since the third quarter of 2022.
Samsung’s position in the smartphone market may be another cause for investor optimism in the wake of Apple’s ongoing difficulties. The firm recently revealed the Galaxy ring in January at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. With the Galaxy ring, Samsung is set to enter the smart wearables market while innovating beyond traditional smartphones.
Although it can be difficult to monitor the long-term consumer appetite for smart wearables, the fallout of Apple’s lawsuit could see the Galaxy ring win a new audience among iPhone users.
Nokia (NOK)
Yes, Nokia ADR (NYSE: NOK ) may be trading at just 5% of its market peak during the Finnish firm’s heyday at the turn of the century, but there’s still plenty for investors to be optimistic about for a stock that’s continued to defy expectations in recent years.
In Q1 2024, NOKIA grew a healthy 4%, and the stock has recently earned the attention of meme investors who have sought to buy into Nokia through a sense of nostalgia and high retail investor sentiment .
Despite the company’s enduring popularity, times have been tough of late for Nokia. Q4 2023 sales of 5.7 billion euros represent a 23% year-over-year decline , while operating profit dropped 27% year-on-year to 846 million euros.
Nokia’s recent hardships have prompted a 600 million euro share buyback scheme in early 2024, and telecommunications operator cutbacks and a slowdown among investments in India have caused the company to forecast more difficulty over the year ahead.
These forecasts make Nokia a riskier opportunity for investors, but it’s important to note that the firm’s slowing sales have already been factored into the market, and it’s also worth highlighting that Nokia is continuing to win new admirers amid growing ‘dumb’ phone market sentiment.
While it’s been hard for Nokia to compete with Android and iOS market leaders, the firm’s power of nostalgia is seeing more users opt for the app-free offerings of Nokia’s streamlined handsets.
While the lure of Nokia’s meme stock status and ‘dumb’ phone popularity could help the company to outperform its expectations in 2024, it may depend on the firm’s relationship with HMD, which has long-manufactured phones for Nokia but may soon begin using its own branding.
Either way, Nokia remains a stock that’s worth tracking as an unpredictable 2024 could deliver plenty of market twists and turns.

2024-04-05,Building Wealth Early: 3 Stocks Every Young Investor Should Own,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Laying a strong financial foundation early in life is crucial when choosing stocks for young investors. Taking advantage of the power of compounding allows even modest investments to grow significantly over extended periods. In other words, small, regular contributions can snowball into a significant nest egg over time. The historical performance of the S&P 500 index, averaging around a 10% annual return with dividends reinvested, exemplifies the wealth-creation potential of equities. Thus, the key is to invest wisely, choosing assets, especially robust stocks, with the potential for long-term growth.
However, sifting through many stocks and navigating the world of ETFs can feel overwhelming. This article simplifies some of the processes, especially for young readers. Today, we’ll explore three stocks for young investors to build wealth steadily in the years ahead.
Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B)
Source: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com
Known for its unparalleled long-term track record, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A , NYSE: BRK-B ) is led by the legendary investor Warren Buffett. Investors eagerly follow Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meetings, where Buffett and colleagues share sage wisdom.
Over the past six decades, Berkshire Hathaway stock has appreciated at an impressive 20% compound annual growth rate, outperforming the S&P 500 by a wide margin. The power of compounding has resulted in remarkable returns for shareholders, making it a compelling choice among our stocks for young investors.
Berkshire focuses on acquiring high-quality companies with strong competitive advantages and strong balance sheets. Management released the fourth quarter and full 2023 results in late February. Net earnings came in at $17.36 per share compared with $8.24 for the same period 12 months ago. Moreover, full-year earnings per share (“EPS) for 2023 was $44.27 versus a loss of $10.33 for 2022. In addition to a jump in operating earnings, the company’s cash holding surged to record levels.
So far in 2024, BRK-B stock has advanced 16%, changing hands at 21.9 times forward earnings. Meanwhile, BRK-B’s 12-month median price forecast stands at $453.61, giving an upside potential of 9% from current levels. For young investors, owning a piece of Berkshire Hathaway can be a smart move toward building long-term wealth.
Shopify (SHOP)
Source: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com
Leading e-commerce platform provider Shopify (NYSE: SHOP ) is next among our stocks for young investors. The company benefits significantly from the sustained shift towards online shopping worldwide.
Fourth quarter revenue grew 24% year-over-year (YOY) to $2.14 billion, translating to even stronger 30% growth after adjusting for the sales of its logistics businesses. Adjusted EPS also surged, reaching $0.34 compared to $0.07 in the prior-year quarter. Free cash flow more than quadrupled YOY as the company moved deeper into positive cash flow territory.
E-commerce is projected to continue strong growth in the coming years, while Shopify sits at the heart of this trend, providing merchants with an all-in-one platform. Given its expanding margins, loyal customer base and commitment to innovation, analysts forecast a 35% revenue growth in 2024.
Yet, SHOP stock has lost 4% year-to-date (YTD), offering a better entry point for new investors. However, we should note that shares still command a premium at 14x trailing sales. Meanwhile, Wall Street’s 12-month price target of $85.00 suggests a potential upside of around 14% from current levels. While Shopify’s stock price will likely be volatile the rest of the year, long-term investors could regard $70 as a better entry point.
SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY)

As one of the most actively traded ETFs globally, the SPDR S&P 500  ETF (NYSEARCA: SPY ) is the final name on our list of stocks for young investors. The SPY fund tracks the performance of the benchmark S&P 500 index, which measures the stock performance of the largest publicly-traded 500 companies stateside that make up around 80% of the overall U.S. stock market’s value.
SPY offers broad exposure to these U.S. businesses’ growth and profitability potential, mitigating single-stock concentration risk. Due to its capitalization-weighted structure, large, well-established firms hold a substantial weighting within the index, influencing their overall performance.
Launched in 1993 as the first US-listed ETF, SPY holds over $530 billion in assets. The five largest names in SPY include Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ), accounting for a quarter of the fund’s roster.
SPY has gained 8% YTD, while the fund’s top 10 holdings have significantly outperformed the broader market. Yet, the current valuation appears slightly expensive, with trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios of 22.0 and 4.5, respectively. A potential decline towards $500 or below during the upcoming earnings season would mean a more opportune entry point for long-term investors.

2024-04-05,The 3 Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in April 2024,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
When Warren Buffett buys a stock he tends to move decisively. It doesn’t mean all of the companies will be massive purchases like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) turned into, hogging up 45% of Berkshire Hathaway ‘s (NYSE: BRK-A )(NYSE: BRK-B ) portfolio. Instead, he will take meaningful positions, whether it’s dollars spent or as a sizeable percentage of the company’s.
Buffett doesn’t hesitate to spend billions of dollars on a company he favors, though. While you likely can’t do that in your own portfolio, following his lead on his purchases still makes sense.
In the six decades Buffett has helmed Berkshire Hathaway, he has generated returns of 4.38 million percent for investors compared to 32,000% for the S&P 500 . Those are investments worth emulating! So if you want to ride his coattails, these are the three best Warren Buffett stocks to buy in April
Occidental Petroleum (OXY)
Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com
Buffett only bought three stocks in the fourth quarter. One of them was oil company Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY ). In his annual letter to shareholders , the Oracle of Omaha extolled the praises of CEO Vicki Hollub. He wrote that under her capable leadership, “Occidental is doing the right things for both its country and its owners.”
Now investors actually have a choice of oil companies to buy as one of the other three stocks he bought was Chevron (NYSE: CVX ). I own the integrated oil and gas giant in my own portfolio but I find Occidental a compelling purchase at these prices. The Permian basin specialist trades at a discount to its larger peer on both a price-to-earnings and price-to-free cash ( FCF ) basis. That means investors are getting a bargain on the profits Occidental makes as well as on the excess cash it generates.
It’s also notable that at the end of 2023, Berkshire Hathaway owned 27.8% of the oil stock. It has SEC permission to buy as much as half of Occidental. And while increasing his stake is possible, Buffett was clear he had no intention of buying the whole thing.
“Though we very much like our ownership, as well as the option [to materially increase its stake], Berkshire has no interest in purchasing or managing Occidental,” he wrote.
American Express (AXP)

Although American Express (NYSE: AXP ) wasn’t one of the stocks Buffett bought last quarter, the credit card giant still holds a considerable portion of his heart. Enough to call out the stock in the shareholder letter.
He pointed out that as good as the company is, in the past it has gone off the rails. It tried to enter verticals not related to its wheelhouse and failed spectacularly. It was also mismanaged. Buffett underscored, though, that is “definitely” not the case now.
Yet owning a stock even if you don’t buy more shares is a declaration of support for the business. And the company rewarded him (and other investors) for his devotion by increasing its earnings and dividends. AmEx is likely to increase its payout this year by 16%.
For the past decade, the credit card leader has raised the dividend by a compounded annual growth rate ( CAGR ) of over 11%. Equally important, FCF has grown at an 8.5% CAGR. With an FCF payout ratio of just 10%, there is plenty of room for additional dividends and growth along the lines of what Buffett is expecting for the coming year.
Japanese Banks

Here you’re getting a five-for-one deal. Buffett owns five Japanese banking giants, each of which was worthy of being mentioned in the annual letter. They are are Itochu (OTCMKTS: ITOCF ) (OTCMKTS: ITOCY ), Marubeni (OTCMKTS: MARUF ), Mitsubishi (OTCMKTS: MSBHF ), Mitsui (OTCMKTS: MITSF ), and Sumitomo (OTCMKTS: SSUMF ) (OTCMKTS: SSUMY ).
These are also investments Buffett is all too willing to be a passive, long-term owner of. While he increased his stake in them last year after visiting with the management of each, Buffett said he promised them he would not increase his ownership interest beyond 9.9% of outstanding shares. Berkshire Hathaway now controls about 9% of the shares of each, so don’t expect to see him buying much more.
That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t buy them. Buffett highlighted how management not only was not as aggressive as their United States counterparts in lining their own pockets but they were all far more shareholder-friendly than U.S. bank managers.
Only about 5% of the banks’ earnings are allocated to dividends. They prefer to allocate more towards building their businesses and repurchasing shares. That’s value creation Buffett admires and you should, too.

2024-04-05,Apple: The DOJ's Weak Antitrust Case,"Apple has a history of antitrust litigation, including a case involving e-book price-fixing and a lawsuit against Qualcomm.
The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has filed a new antitrust suit against Apple, but it is weak and lacks evidence of Apple's monopoly power.
The requested remedies in the suit are mild and are unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's revenue.
Apple ( AAPL ) admittedly has a checkered past when it comes to antitrust regulation, both in this country and the EU. Often, Apple’s management have not seemed to get what antitrust regulation is about or how to comply with it. In the process, Apple has wasted millions in legal fees. However, defending itself against the latest antitrust suit brought by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) will not be a waste. I consider the suit surprisingly ill-conceived and weak.

GCT Semiconductor (NYSE: GCTS ) stock is climbing higher on Friday after the chipmaker announced a deal with Aramco for 5G and 4G semiconductor ecosystems.
According to a press release from the company, this deal will bolster Aramco’s 5G and 4G ecosystems in Saudi Arabia. The goal here is to increase the performance of its “mission-critical and public safety networks.”
GCT Semiconductor CEO John Schlaefer said the following about the Memorandum of Understanding ( MOU ) signed with Aramco:
“We look forward to working with Aramco and leveraging our advanced 4G and 5G capabilities with future-focused AI-driven modem features to help develop the local ecosystem and provide reliable and fast communication for their key applications in Saudi Arabia and the broader region.”
A focus of this collaboration will be chipsets and modules for LTE, 5G and the NTN spectrum. This will allow for the “localization of wireless end-user devices and IoT manufacturing” in Saudi Arabia.
How This Affects GCTS Stock
GCTS stock is experiencing heavy trading on Friday following its deal with Armaco. That has more than 23 million shares changing hands today. To put that in perspective, this is well above its daily average trading volume of 177,00 shares.
GCTS stock is up 60.4% as of Friday morning but still down 13.4% since the start of the year.

2024-04-05,Wells Fargo Is Pounding the Table on Cinemark (CNK) Stock,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Cinemark (NYSE: CNK ) stock is in the news Friday after the movie theater chain was granted a rare double upgrade from Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall.
Wells Fargo bumped shares of CNK stock up from an “underweight” rating to an “overweight” rating. That’s worth noting as the analyst consensus rating for CNK shares is a hold based on 10 opinions.
To go along with that upgrade, Cahall increased the firm’s price target for CNK stock from $13 per share to $23. That’s a potential upside of 22.7% over its previous closing price. It’s also above the analyst consensus price prediction of $18.40 per share.
What’s Behind the CNK Stock Upgrade?
Here’s what the Wells Fargo analysts had to say about Cinemark in a note to clients obtained by StreetInsider :
“Q1 DBO came in 6% above our est. The beat wasn’t on a breakout performance, instead, several films outperformed — a sign that consumer demand is robust w/ legs to next year. CNK has lots of op leverage, and despite its YTD run the stock is still inexpensive.”
CNK stock is up 5.9% as of Friday morning with some 2.9 million shares traded. That’s closing in on its daily average trading volume of about 3 million shares.

2024-04-05,Apple Layoffs 2024: What to Know About the Latest AAPL Job Cuts,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
In a new SEC filing, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) revealed that it had laid off over 600 of its employees after abandoning its Apple Car project. The job cuts were Apple’s largest since the peak of the pandemic. In the wake of the news, Apple and AAPL stock are attracting a great deal of attention today.
More About the Apple Layoffs
According to documents filed with California regulators , Apple’s job cuts will be implemented starting on May 27.
Although the firm did not provide any details about which workers were given pink slips, the Apple layoffs were disclosed shortly after the tech giant decided to terminate its autonomous electric vehicle project. Consequently, there is a great deal of speculation that most of the dismissed employees were working on the now-defunct EV project.
However, some of the workers who had been involved with the EV initiative are now helping to develop Apple’s AI systems.
Robots and Regulators
The iPhone maker is considering getting involved in developing “home robotics” products, Bloomberg reported on April 3. Specifically, the firm has explored creating a robot that can accompany consumers in their homes as well as a stationary home assistant, the news service stated.
On March 21, the Department of Justice sued Apple, alleging that the firm had developed “an illegal monopoly in the smartphone market.” Specifically, the regulator alleges that AAPL has taken steps to prevent competition from arising and then uses the lack of competition to hike prices on its products.
On a positive note, investment bank Evercore recently reported that AAPL’s revenue from its App Store jumped a higher-than-expected 13% last month compared to March 2023.
Heading into today, AAPL stock had retreated 1.5% in the previous five days and was down 12.3% so far in 2024.

2024-04-05,3 Strong Buy AR Stocks to Add to Your Q2 Must-Watch List,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Augmented reality ( AR ), still in its early stages, is set to grow rapidly as recent innovations bring new products to market and ultimately reduce costs. Estimating the market value of augmented reality is challenging, yet conservative predictions suggest it could reach up to $58 billion by 2028, with $38 billion in sales expected this year alone. That growth makes AR stocks a hot opportunity to capitalize on long-term tech trends still in their relative infancy.
With the emergence of any new technology, a flood of new companies, startups and innovators are entering the market, seeking investor attention. But not all will succeed. For those interested in strong buy AR stocks, sticking with well-known, reputable companies is the safest bet today.
Qualcomm (QCOM)
Source: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com
Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ), a leading augmented reality manufacturer, is unlikely to allow new market entrants or current competitors to usurp its position. Its collaborative effort with Samsung and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) reinforces its dominance in hardware and signals a promising future as the augmented reality markets evolve.
The partnership plans to develop a comprehensive mixed-reality platform, capitalizing on Qualcomm’s technological expertise, Samsung’s hardware prowess and Google’s investments in augmented reality tools. While we’re waiting for a definitive product announcement, industry analysts predict the collaboration will result in a series of headsets offering novel virtual reality experiences, which could significantly boost Qualcomm’s revenue.
In addition, Qualcomm is continuously upgrading its broad virtual reality product array, including headsets. Equipped with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processor, these products feature the most advanced WiFi technology and eye-tracking capabilities, driving forward innovation in the augmented reality domain and setting new benchmarks for the industry.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com
Though a ways off from its past $3 trillion market cap, Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) ventures into augmented reality remain a top prospect for investors looking for strong buy AR stocks. The company has impressively sold as many as 200,000 Vision Pro headsets already, despite its hefty $3,499 price tag. Sales are expected to increase as the product’s capabilities become evident to early adopters, and the cost of units eventually declines.
A potential issue on the horizon is the possibility of the Vision Pro cannibalizing sales from other Apple products, particularly tablets and iPads, which are already experiencing a sales decline. Apple finds itself at a pivotal moment, anticipating the stabilization of Vision Pro sales and determining whether this new hardware and augmented reality technology will be a temporary trend or replicate the groundbreaking impact of the iPod in the mid-2000s. Regardless, Apple currently stands as the leading augmented reality stock, making it an excellent choice for investors seeking a blue-chip entry into the burgeoning market.
Meta (META)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
Meta (NASDAQ: META ) closely trails Apple but might soon overtake it as a leader in the augmented reality ( AR ) market. A major consumer review has placed Apple’s Vision Pro and Meta’s Quest Pro on equal footing, rating them both at four stars. However, Quest Pro’s much lower price point positions the product not merely as a cheaper alternative to Apple’s but as a cost-effective innovator independent of the brand-name weight Apple carries. That distinction makes Meta a compelling AR stock option.
Beyond the Quest Pro, Mark Zuckerberg and his team are reportedly working on projects that could significantly impact their AR efforts. In mid-January, Zuckerberg announced significant investments in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) chips. The move supports Meta’s AI development and suggests a major commitment to building a “massive compute infrastructure” likely to enhance AR platforms, particularly with AI integration.
Matching Apple in the realm of blue-chip AR stocks, Meta represents a reliable investment to tap into emerging trends within the developing AR sector.

2024-04-05,Steer Clear of Apple Stock: AAPL Is Cheap for a Reason as Problems Mount,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Could Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) get kicked out of the elite “Magnificent Seven” club this year? Apple is no longer a market darling. We’ve assigned a “D” grade to Apple stock due to company problems.
Apple is a reputable brand that has delivered shareholder value. AAPL stock has been underperforming in 2024 compared to other “Mag-7” stocks. Apple’s current situation is not as “magnificent” as it seems, feel free to explore other technology firms.
Apple Stock’s Poor First-Quarter Performance
Large-cap technology stocks generally did well in this year’s first quarter. Yet, Apple stock declined 7.63% in 2024’s first three months.
Does this mean there’s a terrific buying opportunity with AAPL stock? Not necessarily. Apple is having issues in China, and this could help to explain why the market is losing confidence in Apple.
Here’s a startling statistic about Apple. Believe it or not, iPhone shipments plummeted by approximately 33% year over year in February. This is important, as $72.6 billion of Apple’s $383.3 billion in 2023 total revenue came from China sales.
China is crucial to Apple, but the company appears to be having trouble selling its smartphones there. Reportedly, in the first six weeks of 2024, iPhone sales declined 24% YOY.
If Apple isn’t able to solve this problem soon, there could be implications for the company’s top-line and bottom-line results.
Apple vs. the U.S. Government
Even for a giant company like Apple, waging a battle against the U.S. government is a gargantuan task. Yet, Apple is evidently embroiled in a headline-grabbing lawsuit brought by a powerful government entity.
Here’s the lowdown. As Yahoo! Finance reported recently, the U.S. Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against Apple based on antitrust allegations.
Attorney General Merrick Garland accused Apple of maintaining “its power not because of its superiority, but because of its unlawful exclusionary behavior.”
The idea behind the lawsuit is that allegation that Apple makes it practically impossible for competitors’ apps and devices to succeed. However, Apple has reportedly vowed to fight the Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuit.
Is it a good move for Apple to push back against U.S. regulators? Only time will tell, but it’s almost a certainty that Apple will have to expend time, effort and capital to fight this lawsuit. Plus, Apple may sustain reputational damage along the way.
Avoid Apple Stock as It’s ‘Cheap for a Reason’
This year so far, AAPL stock has been stuck in a rut even while some other technology stock have raced ahead. Meanwhile, Apple’s iPhone-delivery slowdown in China is a major cause for concern.
Meanwhile, Apple’s battle with U.S. antitrust regulators could be protracted and costly. Therefore, Apple stock isn’t necessarily a bargain just because it’s down; we’re calling it “cheap for a reason” and giving the stock a not-so-magnificent “D” grade today.

2024-04-04,3 Tech Stock Titans Grappling With Fresh China Challenges,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
China is a conundrum. With 900 million people, the country is the world’s biggest consumer market and United States companies love tapping into it. Whether it’s a new expansion opportunity or just a way to stave off slowing growth in more mature and saturated markets, companies eagerly do business there. Yet it’s problematic, too. Just ask these tech stock titans.
Foremost is China’s use of slave labor. Human Rights Watch says the government uses Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslim communities in forced labor camps . Products including car parts, solar panels and apparel from businesses such as PDD Holdings ‘ (NASDAQ: PDD ) Temu and Schein are regularly sold in the U.S. And American companies as wide-ranging as Nike (NYSE: NKE ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) have endured scrutiny for tainting their supply chains by using forced labor products.
The ongoing war in Ukraine also helped raise tensions between Washington and Beijing that spilled over into trade issues. President Biden imposed restrictions on the sale of semiconductors and advanced technology to China which retaliated with restrictions of its own. Not just in computer chips but by subsidizing local companies to challenge sales by U.S. corporations. Other businesses are simply prohibited from operating there. Twitter and Facebook are two companies banned over free speech fears.
These three tech stocks facing China challenges face very high hurdles to spur sales growth.
Intel (INTC)

One of the most high-profile fallouts from heightened trade tensions is China blocking Intel ‘s (NASDAQ: INTC ) chips from beiung used in government computers and servers. Reminiscent of the arguments U.S. politicians are using to ban TikTok or force its sale, China issued a list of “safe and reliable” CPUs, databases and operating systems companies could use. The products were all from Chinese companies.
Also caught up in the ban are chips from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) and Microsoft ‘s (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Windows operating system. But it’s a heavy blow to Intel, which was looking to China expansion to revitalize its growth efforts.
Nearly 75% of Intel’s revenue comes from outside the U.S. China represents 27% of the chipmaker’s $54.2 billion total revenue, or almost $15 billion. The country also represents 15% of Advanced Micro’s $23 billion revenues.
Intel’s stock is down 23% year to date as a result of disappointing guidance issued earlier this year. As trade war hawks in both political parties rail against China in an election year, don’t expect INTC stock to run much higher.
Tesla (TSLA)

It’s not just in the U.S. where the fervor for electric vehicles ( EV ) is subsiding. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) saw its market share in China slip to 6.6% in the first two months of 2024 from 7.6% last year as overall EV sales slowed. Coupled with increased competition from Chinese manufacturers like BYD (OTCMKTS: BDDYF ), Nio (NYSE: NIO ) and Li Auto (NASDAQ: LI ), the going is getting tough for Tesla.
The EV maker reported first-quarter deliveries tumbled 8.5% to 386,810 vehicles where analysts had expected 457,000 deliveries. It also marked a 20% slide in sales sequentially. However, Tesla’s consolation prize was regaining the title of world’s largest EV maker after BYD reported deliveries plummeted 43% to 300,411 vehicles.
All EV manufacturers are now locked in a price-cutting war that will likely decimate profits for the companies. Tesla slashed prices on its Model 3 and Model Y cars in China earlier this year. It also began offering cash discounts on Model Ys beginning Feb. 1. Now the EV maker is offering additional incentives on cars in China, including insurance, paint colors and financing options. It’s likely its rivals will respond as they did to Tesla’s earlier buyer enticements.
Tesla stock is down 34% year-to-date and could go lower as sales slow and discounting heats up. Drop this and the other tech stock titans we mentioned.
Apple (AAPL)

The third tech stock facing China challenges is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). It saw iPhone shipments tumble 33% in February, according to Bloomberg News . There were only 2.4 million devices shipped that month but the number was affected by China’s Lunar New Year holiday. As Apple is the only cross-border company with a sizable market share in China, it bore the brunt of the decline.
The tech giant has been working overtime to smooth relations in the country. CEO Tim Cook recently traveled to China to meet with government officials and open a new flagship store in Shanghai. He promised to increase Apple’s investment in China in the long run. With the new iPhone 16 due out later this year, Cook wants to ensure the road to sales is paved before its debut.
Apple also recently reached a $490 million settlement with plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit. They alleged Cook lied to shareholders in 2019 by concealing just how bad the iPhone was selling in China. Apple surprised the market by slashing quarterly revenue forecasts by $9 billion on declining demand in China. The situation is emblematic of the ongoing difficulty U.S. companies face when doing business there.
Apple stock is down 12% so far this year. This and the other tech stock titans we have mentioned need to be dropped soon.

2024-04-04,"TSLA Stock Alert: Cathie Wood Is Pounding the Table on a $2,000 Tesla Price Target","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
While Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) stock continues to grab headlines for being the single-biggest loser so far in 2024, there’s one major investor who thinks the electric vehicle (EV) maker is due for a recovery: Cathy Wood. The Ark Invest manager believes that Tesla’s more than 30% drawdown is just a road bump before CEO Elon Musk’s brainchild soars to new highs.
How high you might ask?
Wood has a $2,000 price target on TSLA stock. For context, the stock currently trades for $171 per share.
Wood recently discussed her optimism for Tesla, arguing that the company is still positioned strongly for the all-electric future. “Now is not the time to run for the hills,” Wood said in an interview with CNBC .
Ark Invest recently bought up millions of dollars worth of Tesla ahead of the company’s first-quarter earnings call last week. Unfortunately, the company’s financial results were nothing short of disappointing, further digging Tesla into the red.
Still, Wood believes that Tesla’s future is bright. The fund manager thinks that Tesla will hit its stride when it eventually rolls out its robotaxi business, which she estimates could contribute to $10 trillion in revenue by 2030.
Wood is a long-time Tesla fan, having once maintained a price target of $5,000 per share for TSLA stock.
TSLA Stock Suffers Brutal Losses Following Earnings Bust
Despite Wood’s faith, much of Wall Street has abandoned Tesla. Indeed, the EV maker has already shed more than $240 billion in value in 2024, with some analysts even claiming that the “Magnificent Seven” is now the “Fab Four,” cutting Tesla, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) from the roster.
Not for nothing, Tesla has largely failed to meet expectations this year. In its recently posted Q1 financial results, the company announced a year-over-year (YOY) decline in global vehicle deliveries — for the first time since 2020 .
The company has seen a sharp pullback in EV demand, attributable to a number of possible headwinds, including increased competition in China.
“[It] was a messy first quarter,” noted Guggenheim Securities analyst Ronald Jewsikow . “The demand is slowing, China competition is strong, and then Europe hasn’t grown for five quarters now for Tesla. Structurally, there’s emerging risks in all three regions that, even as we move beyond a very messy first quarter earnings result, there’s reasons for concern.”
Whether this once-upon-a-time EV darling reclaims its seat among new tech giants, remains to be seen.

2024-04-04,Smart Money Favorites: 3 Stocks Top Money Managers Can't Live Without,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Investment managers tend to flock to a select group of outperforming stocks that drive consistent returns. The stocks top money managers can’t live without generally hail from sectors like technology, healthcare and consumer staples.
However, tech reigns supreme, hosting stocks that permeate most portfolios. In particular, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) represent core technology holdings found among an overwhelming majority of money managers. For instance, Apple constitutes Warren Buffett’s top position at Berkshire Hathaway, making up over 40% of its holdings. Meanwhile, Ken Fisher, Mairs and Power, Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management and Fidelity’s Contrafund all share top stakes in Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon as well.
Exciting AI and metaverse plays like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) entice more risk-tolerant managers. However, Microsoft, Appl and Amazon remain the cherished stocks top money managers can’t live without thanks to their dominant positions and immense growth runways in cloud computing, e-commerce and beyond. This article explores why these big tech companies represent such a significant allocation across top investment managers’ portfolios.
Microsoft (MSFT)
Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com
With its strong fundamentals and competitive edge, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is undoubtedly one of the stocks top money managers can’t live without. As many portfolio managers have wisely realized, Microsoft is exceptionally positioned for long-term outperformance. This is especially obvious when taking into account the near monopoly the company holds across some of the company’s key business segments.
Powering Microsoft’s success is its cloud dominance. The tech titan’s robust cloud platform remains unrivaled, fueling its Q2 2024 revenue growth to $62 billion , up 18% year-over-year. Such financial strength confirms Microsoft’s near monopoly status in major tech sectors. Plus, with sturdy operating income up 33% to $27 billion for the quarter, Microsoft has the backing to continue expanding its cloud, AI and metaverse lead.
Adding to its upside potential, Microsoft is making big metaverse moves — evidenced by its monumental $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard last October. This deal fortifies Microsoft’s supremacy in gaming while allowing for tremendous metaverse monetization ahead. With gaming revenue already up 61% in Q2 2024, Microsoft is clearly on track to deliver metaverse profits down the road.
Given its cloud dominance, metaverse momentum and exceptional growth metrics this quarter, Microsoft epitomizes one of the key stocks top money managers can’t live without for both present returns and future-forward gains.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com
Its coveted brand and dominant position in consumer technology make Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) one of the favored stocks top money managers can’t live without. The iPhone maker continues to ride on hardware sales and services revenue, surpassing Wall Street estimates.
In its latest earnings report for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, ending Dec. 31, 2023, Apple posted over $119 billion in quarterly revenue , an increase of 2% YoY. Fueled by robust iPhone demand during the holiday season, Apple even faced supply chain constraints that limited sales growth. Still, the results beat expectations. This resilience confirms why Apple remains a favorite among institutional investors and top money managers.
Bolstering its hardware ecosystem further, Apple recently unveiled a mixed-reality headset called Vision Pro in January 2024 . The $3,499 premium device with both AR and VR capabilities targets creative professionals and showcases Apple’s ambitions in futuristic technologies. Although niche for now, it expands Apple’s total addressable market.
With immense brand loyalty and an installed base exceeding 1.8 billion active devices globally, Apple retains pricing power and stable revenues. Top money managers see these qualities as enduring competitive strengths no matter the economic climate. Additionally, Apple’s services segment hit an all-time revenue record of $23.1 billion last quarter , up 11%. Offerings like Apple Music, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade and more drive this high-margin recurring revenue stream. Such resilience makes Apple one of the stocks top money managers can’t live without, even amidst market uncertainty.
Amazon (AMZN)
Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com
Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has firmly established itself as one of the stocks top money managers can’t live without thanks to its dominant position in global e-commerce and cloud computing. The company reported staggering net sales of $574.8 billion in 2023, up 12% year-over-year. Operating income also soared to $36.9 billion, triple that of the previous year.
Driving this growth is Amazon’s core online retail segment, which continues to make up a significant portion of total sales. However, its true crown jewel is Amazon Web Services (AWS) — the company’s cloud computing arm. AWS raked in revenue of $91 billion in 2023, with operating margins hitting a superb 30%. With the global cloud market expected to hit $1.6 trillion by 2030 , AWS provides an immense growth runway.
Geographically, too, Amazon still has plenty of room to expand. Online shopping only accounts for 16% of total U.S. retail sales, a number that Amazon has greatly influenced. By securing nearly 40% of all U.S. e-commerce spending, Amazon is poised to benefit tremendously as more shopping moves online. Given these outstanding fundamentals and growth prospects, it is no wonder that money managers view Amazon as a core long-term holding. Nearly every major mutual fund has a sizable stake in Amazon stock. With dominant positions in two high-growth markets, Amazon remains undoubtedly one of the stocks top money managers can’t live without.

2024-04-04,Value Vault: 3 Stocks That Dominate This Investing Icon's Portfolio,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management comes from investing royalty. His father, Philip Fisher, wrote the investment classic “Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits” and whom Morningstar called “one of the great investors of all time.” He was a long-term, buy-and-hold investor who, like Warren Buffett, believed the best time to sell a stock was “almost never.”
Many of those attributes were passed down to his son, who manages $265 billion in assets under management ( AUM ). Despite its size, Fisher Asset Management has notched some impressive gains over the past decade. The firm’s 10-year annual returns are north of 58%, while over the last five years, Fisher returned 63%. In just the last 12 months he is up to 24%.
Although he has a large portfolio containing well over 900 companies, these are the three stocks dominating this investing icon’s portfolio today.
Amazon (AMZN)
Source: Daniel Fung / Shutterstock
Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) recently slipped to fifth place as the most valuable company in Fisher’s portfolio, but its performance so far this year has been stellar. AMZN stock is up 20% year to date and more than 76% higher over the past year.
Because the online retailer is so integral to the economy, it was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average . It’s not just because of its e-commerce platform but also its cloud services business, which provides the backbone for the internet presence of numerous companies. And it continues to improve itself.
Cost-cutting measures and integration of artificial intelligence ( AI ) are paying benefits to Amazon. Strong revenue and better profit margins over the past few quarters are just some of the tangible results of its efforts. Perhaps most notable is the surge in advertising revenue, up 27% last quarter to $14.7 billion. It is already the third-largest ad platform behind Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ).
Fisher owns 41.8 million shares of Amazon stock worth $7.6 billion, making it the fourth-largest position in his portfolio at 3.7% of the total. With an average purchase price of around $54 per share, Fisher has seen his investment more than triple in value.
Microsoft (MSFT)
Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com
Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is the biggest position Fisher owns. It represents 5% of his portfolio. Few stocks are as closely associated with AI as Microsoft. Having integrated OpenAI’s ChatGPT generative AI technology into all aspects of its operations, the tech giant is receiving significant dividends.
AI contributed 600 basis points of growth to Microsoft’s Azure cloud services business last quarter, double what it had done just one quarter prior. It is also helping Microsoft land more and bigger deals for longer contractual periods of time.
Clients like Azure. It allows them to grow their transition to the cloud at their own pace. The hybrid environment lets them choose the level of service they want and where they want it. They can choose between on-premises, in the cloud or a combination of both. Expect to see AI’s growth rate and contribution to Microsoft accelerate in the coming quarters.
Fisher owns 25.4 million shares of MSFT stock worth $10.7 billion. He’s generated gains of 291% so far with his average purchase price of $107 per share.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com
The No. two holding in Fisher Asset Management is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Despite all the headwinds the consumer electronics stock faces, Apple has tripled Fisher’s investment from the average buy-in price of $51 per share. Yet the headwinds are legion.
Most notable is the Justice Dept. suing Apple for antitrust violations. Although some of the allegations seem ludicrous, such as operating a monopoly when it has but a 57% share of the domestic smartphone market, it will be a distraction for management as it fights back against the charges.
Apple also has its work cut out for it in China, one of its biggest markets but also one that has seen sales slow dramatically. Its iPhone sales reportedly plummeted 33% in China in January and February, according to Bloomberg News. Of course, March tends to be the strongest month of the three in the quarter, so we will need to see how the iPhone fared then.
The consumer tech leader has its next iteration of the smartphone coming out later this year. The iPhone 16 should also have some form of Google’s own AI technology accessible so it could be a big seller.
Apple stock is down 9% year-to-date, but no one suggests the party is over by a long shot.

2024-04-04,3 AI Stocks That Will Leave Nvidia in the Dust,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Microchip and semiconductor concern Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) has led the market ever since the current rally began in autumn 2022. Its run has been incredible . Since October 2022, NVDA stock has increased 695%. The company’s share price has risen an astounding 1,765% over the last five years. The growth has pushed Nvidia’s market capitalization to above $2 trillion and made it the third largest publicly traded company in the world after Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ).
The key to the success of NVDA stock has been the rising demand for the company’s chips and semiconductors, which are used to power artificial intelligence models and applications. The massive worldwide demand has led to a surge in Nvidia’s sales and profits. For the final quarter of 2023, Nvidia reported that its sales increased 265% from a year earlier and its profits grew 769% year over year. The company’s earnings reports have become a highly anticipated and closely watched event across the entire stock market.
So who will be the next Nvidia? Which companies are positioned to steal its crown? Here are three AI stocks that will leave Nvidia in the dust.
Micron Technology (MU)

Shares of Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU ) are running circles around Nvidia right now. MU stock has risen by 34% in the past month after the company announced financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts and provided upbeat forward guidance driven by AI demand. Micron, which makes memory and storage for computers and specializes in USB flash drives, announced in March earnings per share of 42 cents compared to a loss of 25 cents that was expected among analysts who cover the company.
Revenue amounted to $5.82 billion versus $5.35 billion, which was expected on Wall Street. Management said the company is benefitting from the current AI boom , with demand for its memory and computer data storage products rising. Micron provides memory and storage for new AI systems around the world. Looking ahead, executives said they expect to report revenue of $6.60 billion for the just-completed first quarter, which is above the $6.02 billion that was expected by analysts.
Thanks to its post-earnings bounce, MU stock has now been up 55% since the start of this year and has more than doubled over the last 12 months.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) is nipping at Nvidia’s heels. One of its most direct competitors, AMD, as the company is known, has developed a series of microchips specifically for AI models and applications that it hopes will rival Nvidia’s chips and semiconductors. Last December, AMD unveiled a new series of microchips called the “ Ryzen 8040 ” that are aimed at boosting AI applications by up to 60%. Those new chips will be incorporated into laptops and personal computers (PCs).
AMD has also launched the new MI300X accelerator microchip that’s used in data centers and servers and competes against Nvidia’s AI data center chips. Companies ranging from Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) to Microsoft have been buying up the MI300X chips, and AMD executives have said that they expect the data center microchips to generate $2 billion in sales for all of this year. The new AI microchips and decent earnings have AMD stock up 87% over the last 12 months, including a 30% gain so far in 2024.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM)
Source: ToyW / Shutterstock
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE: TSM ) is arguably the most important company to Nvidia and the entire AI industry. This is because TSMC, as the company is popularly known, makes three-quarters (75%) of the microchips in the world, including those designed by Nvidia, as well as nearly all the chips and semiconductors that power AI technologies. The growing importance of TSMC to the AI and chip industries has its stock up by 52% in the last year, including a 39% year-to-date gain.
During their most recent earnings call , TSMC executives said that the company is well-positioned to capture current and future growth opportunities, especially related to AI. Taiwan Semiconductor is increasingly focused on AI chips and semiconductors as it executes a global expansion plan. The company recently opened its first microchip plant in Japan, moving beyond its home market in Taiwan. It is also developing two new microchip plants in Arizona at a cost of $40 billion. TSM stock has more than tripled over the last five years.

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) became the first company to reach the trillion-dollar milestone. A few years later, Apple had company. Most Magnificent Seven stocks have valuations exceeding $1 trillion, and other stocks look poised to join them.
The $1 trillion valuation implies sizable gains for the investments on this list. The jump may require a 30% to 50% increase for these promising tech stocks . Some of them have the potential to become trillion-dollar stocks by the end of the year, while others may reach the milestone by 2030.
These are some of the top tech stocks set to join the trillion-dollar club.
Broadcom (AVGO)
Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com
Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO ) is the easiest choice on this list. The semiconductor giant has the largest market cap of these picks and comes in with a $633 billion market cap. The company’s 50 P/E ratio and artificial intelligence ( AI ) tailwinds can give it the extra momentum it needs to attain trillion-dollar status.
The stock is surrounded by enthusiasts, as it is currently rated a Strong Buy. The lowest price target still implies some upside, while the average price target indicates a 16% gain is in the cards. The highest price target of $1,720 per share suggests the stock could gain an additional 26% from current levels.
Broadcom’s recent acquisition of VMware has already translated into higher revenue growth. Revenue increased by 34% year-over-year (YoY), and the company believes it can exceed $50 billion in fiscal 2024 revenue. The corporation helped itself toward this goal by repurchasing $8.29 billion worth of shares.
Visa (V)

Visa (NYSE: V ) is a fintech company that offers credit and debit cards. The company makes a small percentage of every credit and debit card transaction. Many investors use Visa’s financial reports as an indicator of broader U.S. economic performance.
Visa gave its investors and broader market participants reasons to cheer in its latest earnings report. Revenue increased by 9% YoY in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. GAAP net income was up by 17% YoY, reaching $4.9 billion. Those growth rates helped the company bring in a 56.6% net profit margin.
Visa stock is up by 76% over the past five years and has momentum on its side. The stock is up 7% year-to-date and 21% over the past year. The stock trades at a $572 billion market cap, more than halfway toward the trillion-dollar milestone. Visa shares trade at a 32 P/E ratio and offer a 0.75% yield.
Adobe (ADBE)

Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) would have to more than quadruple to reach a $1 trillion market cap, so investors will have to be very patient with this one. The stock has a $224 billion market cap and a 48 P/E ratio. Shares are up by 86% over the past five years.
Adobe generates recurring revenue from its popular software products. Creatives and businesses use Adobe’s products to create captivating graphics and videos. The company’s video editing tools are some of the best in the industry.
Adobe recently reported Q1 fiscal 2024 results. Revenue reached a record $5.18 billion. That’s 11% higher than the same period last year. Diluted EPS came to $1.36 on a GAAP basis. Adobe closed the quarter with $17.58 billion in remaining performance obligations, a healthy backlog. The company tapped into its financial strength to repurchase 3.1 million shares in the quarter.

2024-04-04,Cashing in on the Bitcoin Bounce: 3 Stocks to Buy for Indirect Crypto Exposure,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
You’re at the right place if you’re seeking stocks for indirect crypto exposure. While Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETFs are witnessing unprecedented inflows and nudging towards all-time highs, not all investors are convinced of crypto viability as a long-term investment. For instance, Vanguard Group executives view Bitcoin as too speculative for inclusion in buy-and-hold portfolios (hence their lack of interest in launching a Bitcoin ETF). But, even for crypto skeptics, opportunities for indirect crypto exposure and traditional stock stability abound.
Investing in companies with significant involvement in blockchain-related activities provides indirect exposure to crypto while allowing for diversification across various applications beyond blockchain, such as identity verification and contract settlements.
The rising interest in artificial intelligence has overshadowed blockchain technologies, yet companies in this space present numerous investment opportunities with substantial long-term growth potential. These investments allow those hesitant about direct cryptocurrency investments to benefit from Bitcoin’s performance. They may also provide superior returns compared to direct cryptocurrency holdings over an extended period.
Stocks for Indirect Crypto Exposure: MercadoLibre (MELI)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
Crypto’s popularity is surging in Latin America, with countries like El Salvador integrating Bitcoin into their legal tender system. MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI ), an Argentinian e-commerce giant, is contributing to this trend by introducing its own cryptocurrency, akin to PayPal’s (NASDAQ: PYPL ) strategy, to offer shareholders indirect crypto exposure. In addition to its proprietary Mercado coin, MercadoLibre is capitalizing on the broader blockchain movement by providing a digital wallet that enables crypto trading across multiple assets, including Bitcoin.
MercadoLibre’s value extends beyond its indirect crypto exposure to diversify shareholder interests, as it remains a significant force in Latin America’s wider eCommerce sector. The company has reported consistent revenue and net income growth over the last five quarters , with sales nearing $15 billion by the end of 2023. Moreover, MercadoLibre’s management excels at managing debt, a notable achievement among tech and rapidly expanding eCommerce companies. This financial prudence is crucial for navigating the economic instability in Latin American markets, safeguarding the company and its investors.

Among its multiple revenue streams, Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO ) assists business owners with incorporating blockchain technology into their daily operations. The tech stock distinguishes itself by focusing on blockchain integration’s essential infrastructure and security aspects, providing the backbone to adopt, integrate, and manage the tech across various applications . Broadcom is diversifying its revenue streams by moving towards blockchain services and addressing previous concerns about revenue concentration, especially following its VMware merger .
Previously, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) contributed to more than 20% of Broadcom’s revenue through its 5G and wireless component segments. However, with the synergies from VMware’s cloud computing and a focus on blockchain technology, Broadcom is lessening its dependence on revenue from a single source. Investors should note that integrating VMware will incur about $1 billion in transaction costs in the short term. Nevertheless, like adopting blockchain technology, this temporary volatility is a worthwhile investment for indirect crypto exposure.
SBI Holdings Inc (SBHGF)

SBI Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS: SBHGF ), a vast Japanese conglomerate, operates across various sectors, including financial services, asset management, healthcare data, and biotechnology. However, the company’s indirect crypto exposure potential primarily stems from its “ crypto-asset business .” This venture integrates a variety of crypto-related and blockchain initiatives to enhance the SBI Group’s financial ecosystem in preparation for an increasingly digital finance landscape.
The company has committed up to $100 million in investments to global crypto startups, offering essential funding to smaller firms challenged by the high interest rates that render debt financing exceedingly costly. Moreover, investors can take comfort in SBI’s diverse range of services, contributing to its steady profitability , a claim supported by its decently high dividend yield .
Shares dipped late last year amid accusations of stock manipulation that, thus far, haven’t been borne out by investigators. Shares are slowly returning to past highs, but it isn’t too late to get indirect crypto exposure from this unique stock.

2024-04-04,Hidden Gem Alert: Why Baidu Stock Is a Bargain Buy for Savvy Investors,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Sometimes, you have to expand your geographic horizons to find the best deals in the financial markets. A case in point is Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ) shares, which are trading at a discount right now. Don’t expect Baidu stock to be underpriced for much longer, though, as the company could soon strike a deal with a famous smartphone manufacturer.
Based in China, Baidu is a search-engine market dominator that also specializes in artificial intelligence technology. You might not know this, but Baidu also launched the first 24/7 robo-taxi service in China. It’s a fascinating company that’s not a darling on Wall Street – but that’s exactly why value seekers should be in a mood to buy BIDU stock now.
Baidu Stock Is Cheap Despite the Company’s Revenue Growth
How cheap is Baidu stock now? It’s been as high as $150 multiple times during the past several years, but recently only traded at around $105.
During a time when the U.S. market is hyper-focused on the “Magnificent Seven,” Baidu is an undervalued business. Baidu’s GAAP trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is 13.51x , versus the sector median P/E ratio of 19.52x.
Baidu, like the “Mag-7” companies, is heavily involved in AI technology. Baidu isn’t in financial trouble. You might think the company is in bad shape, based on the share-price action. However, Baidu’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 revenue actually grew 6% year over year to 34,951 RMB .
In addition, Baidu’s full-year 2023 revenue increased 9% YOY to 134.6 billion RMB. Remember, investors shouldn’t try to compare Baidu’s revenue growth to that of U.S.-based Magnificent Seven companies.
China’s economy, without a doubt, has faced significant challenges and this makes Baidu’s sales growth all the more impressive.
Baidu Could Soon Have an Agreement With Apple
Another pillar of the bull case for Baidu stock is the company’s potential agreement with well-known smartphone manufacturer Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). If you’re still on the fence, this news item ought to convince you to invest in Baidu while the company is still undervalued.
Here’s the scoop. According to The Wall Street Journal , Apple “ held preliminary talks with” Baidu about the possibility of using Baidu’s generative-AI technology in Apple’s devices in China.
This team up, if it happens, would benefit both companies. Apple’s AI-enhanced devices would be more likely to satisfy China-based regulators’ inspections and requirements. As for Baidu, the company would have a powerful, capital-rich and globally recognized partner.
Baidu Stock: This Sounds Like the Deal of a Lifetime
Could this be the best tech-sector deal of 2024? No, I’m not talking about the potential deal between Baidu and Apple, though that would certainly be monumental if it happens.
Rather, I’m referring to the unbeatable deal you can get right now with Baidu stock. The shares are reasonably valued, and Baidu recently demonstrated solid revenue growth. Hence, I encourage you to think globally and, before the opportunity passes you by, put some Baidu shares in your portfolio.

2024-04-03,7 Tech Stocks to Sell in April Before They Crash and Burn,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Stocks may already be off to a rough start this month, but it’s not too late to consider getting out of the tech stocks to sell in April. The reasons for this are twofold. First, the market could continue to change direction.
Now that there’s greater uncertainty about when the Federal Reserve will begin lowering interest rates, volatility may continue for the stocks most sensitive to interest rates, which includes high-growth tech stocks.
Second, beyond macro factors, with many top names in tech, there are company-specific concerns that should warrant a fast exit. Some of these problem-plagued tech names have already started to decline due to such issues. However, even in these situations, it is far too early to say that the dust has settled.
With this in mind, let’s take a look at the following seven tech stocks to sell in April. Interestingly enough, two of them are “Magnificent Seven” components.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com
Most of the “Mag 7” stocks have been in the green thus far in 2024, but not Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Shares in the iPhone maker have experienced a moderate move lower since the start of the year. Weak demand for the company’s iconic product, especially in China , has weighed heavily on shares.
In addition, there’s an antitrust suit filed against Apple by the U.S. Department of Justice, and 15 U.S. state attorney generals. Following the recent AAPL stock slump, some may be saying that this tech giant has become a buy on the dip. Largely, due to the possible emergence of a generative AI catalyst for shares.
Still, the above-mentioned headwinds will continue to persist in the near-term. Apple is expected to next report earnings sometime in early May. With some analysts anticipating disappointment with Apple’s upcoming fiscal results, AAPL may be on the verge of another pullback.
IBM (IBM)
Source: shutterstock.com/LCV
Thanks to “AI mania,” IBM (NYSE: IBM ) shares have finally broken from a more than decade-long slump. Yet while those early to the gen AI trade in “Big Blue” have profited, not only is it too late to pounce on this opportunity.
The AI catalyst may now be excessively priced into IBM stock. As I argued last month, investors are perhaps overestimating how much gen AI-related growth will boost the tech giant’s overall operating performance. Sure, this may be merely a case of splitting hairs, if “AI mania” is set to continue.
But if “AI mania” is fading, and a changing market drives a sell-off for AI stocks , IBM could reverse course. Irrespective of an “AI bust,” if IBM’s growth fails to re-accelerate in the coming quarters, a sell-off could still occur. With major downside risk in mind, consider IBM one of the tech stocks to sell in April.
Intel (INTC)
Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
Just like IBM, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) is another “old school” tech name that has experienced a big rally thanks to all the excitement surrounding the rise of gen AI. Over the past six months, the chip maker’s shares have rallied by nearly 24%.
That said, some negative factors have started to weigh on INTC stock. This includes a recent China chip crackdown , but a larger concern has to do with Intel’s foundry business. Intel’s plans to become a major foundry, or third-party manufacturer of semiconductors for “fabless” chip designers, have been a key component of its overall turnaround plans.
However, with this unit reporting big losses, and not expected to hit breakeven until 2027 , the Intel turnaround appears to be taking longer-than-expected. With shares trading as if a turnaround has already happened, at 32.1 times forward earnings, INTC may be in for a de-rating, as investors reset expectations.
Shopify (SHOP)
Source: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com
Slowing growth and a rich valuation is what makes Shopify (NYSE: SHOP ) one of the tech stocks to sell in April. Since the pandemic, this e-commerce software company has scaled up significantly. Reporting around $1.6 billion in revenue during 2019, last year Shopify’s top line came in at over $7 billion.
However, after this significant scale-up, which has also resulted in a move to consistent profitability, things are slowing down for Shopify. Revenue increased by around 26% last year, but top-line growth is expected to decelerate to around 20% this year and next year.
Earnings growth is also decelerating. This calls into question the super-high valuation of SHOP stock. Shares today trade for a staggering 76.2 times forward earnings. Potentially at risk of being “priced for perfection,” following Shopify’s upcoming earnings release on May 2, the stock could experience a heavy post-earnings sell-off.
Snowflake (SNOW)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock
Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW ) is another situation where the market put the cart before the horse, with regard to potential AI-related tailwinds for this cloud data company. As you may recall, SNOW experienced a big run-up in price between November and February.
However, the direction of SNOW stock changed dramatically starting on Feb 28. As I recently discussed, that’s when investors bailed on Snowflake , following the company’s latest quarterly earnings release, which coincided with the surprising news of Snowflake CEO Frank Slootman’s resignation.
Yet even after SNOW’s more than 32% drop since this spate of disheartening news, more downside may lie ahead. Shares trade for 163.6 times forward earnings. AI optimism may enable shares to sustain this valuation today, but as Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co. analyst Brian White recently argued, skepticism about the AI catalyst could increase . In turn, this could lead to significant multiple compression for shares.
Atlassian (TEAM)
Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com
Atlassian (NASDAQ: TEAM ) is a purveyor of project management software. Its products include Jira, Confluence, and Trello. Again, like many other enterprise software stocks , TEAM late last year and early this year received a major boost thanks to the AI trend.
Just like similar plays, this boost has long since peaked. TEAM stock has slid 17.6% lower since the start of the year. Admittedly, it may be an overstatement to say that this represents a major sell-off. However, another round of big price declines may be just around the corner. Why?
Post-market on April 25, Atlassian will release its latest quarterly results and guidance . Even if the company delivers an earnings beat, updates to guidance could fall short, much like what happened last quarter . To avoid getting caught holding the bag in the event of a post-earnings sell-off, consider TEAM one of the tech stocks to sell in April.
Tesla (TSLA)
Source: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com
Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) continues to take a big tumble. The latest move lower for the EV maker’s has been driven by disappointing quarterly deliveries data. Reported deliveries of 386,810 vehicles came in below already walked-back expectations.
Softening demand and falling margins have been at the root of the TSLA stock sell-off. These major negatives are likely to continue in the near-term. Clearly not immune to the cyclicality of the auto business, there’s now even more reason to question why TSLA’s massive valuation premium to other automotive stocks .
Previously, I’ve argued that an opportunity may emerge to snap up this Mag 7 component at a “can’t miss” price. However, at around $165 per share, TSLA has a ways to go before reaching the buy zone, which is around $100 per share . In the meantime, exit any existing Tesla stock positions, and wait for this ideal entry point.

2024-04-03,7 Nancy Pelosi Stocks Still Worth Buying in Q2,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
In a politically divisive ecosystem, about the only thing we can achieve bipartisanship on are Nancy Pelosi stocks. Yes, the former House Speaker herself represents a lightning rod for controversy. Yet she seems to know her way around the market.
That’s not surprising. Love her or not love her (let’s not get too negative here), we must respect her shrewd gamesmanship and intellect. Of course, depending on where you land in the political spectrum, you’re going to disagree with that last point. That’s okay. The point is you can’t be a complete fool to be elected to Congress.
Well, maybe I shouldn’t have said that. Let’s move on – below are still-relevant Nancy Pelocy stocks still worth buying in the second quarter.
Palo Alto Networks (PANW)
Source: Shutterstock
Falling under the broader technology ecosystem, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW ) plies its trade in the software infrastructure space. Specifically, it’s one of the top names in the cybersecurity realm, an increasingly important arena. While we talk a great game about rising innovations such as artificial intelligence, they also potentially leave us vulnerable to nefarious activities.
Fundamentally, it’s one of the Nancy Pelosi stocks to buy for the obvious reason that cybercriminals will continue committing crimes. What’s worse, AI could lower the threshold for budding hackers, making enterprise security all the more relevant. Therefore, it’s not at all surprising that in the last fiscal year, the company beat all four quarterly bottom-line targets.
For the current fiscal year, analysts anticipate earnings per share of $5.50 . That’s a significant increase over last year’s print of $4.44. On the top line, they believe revenue could reach $7.98 billion. Again, that’s a noticeable bump (15.8%) over fiscal 2023’s $6.89 billion tally. It’s easily one of the Nancy Pelosi stocks to buy in Q2.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com
Consumer technology giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) needs no introduction, if only for the reason that there’s a very good chance you own one of its products. If viewership metrics are anything to go by, there’s also a solid chance you’re reading this on an Apple device. Naturally, AAPL stock makes for a solid investment despite pressures against the economy.
Yes, discretionary spending faces significant headwinds. That’s not a shocking statement after years of high inflation and high borrowing costs. Nevertheless, Apple has a social cachet that can’t be ignored. People need its products even though technically, they don’t need it. Such a backdrop has led to consistent profitability. Last fiscal year, Apple beat all its quarterly bottom-line targets.
For the current fiscal year, analysts are looking for EPS of $6.56. That’s a decent bump from last year’s metric of $6.13. On the revenue front, we’re not looking at great numbers: an average estimate of $387.95 billion against last year’s print of $383.29 billion. Still, for overall stability, AAPL could make a solid case for Nancy Pelosi stocks to buy.
Microsoft (MSFT)
Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com
Another big play among Nancy Pelosi stocks that requires no introduction, I’m definitely using Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) products to write this story. So, you know who to blame. In all seriousness, Microsoft’s Software as a Service (SaaS) is an indispensable asset in the business or academic world. You can play around with other platforms but when things need to get done, Microsoft is the name (almost) everyone turns to.
Yes, the spotlight centers on the company’s major investments in AI. So far, this directive has proved very lucrative. Nevertheless, I like Microsoft for its everyday relevancies: the aforementioned SaaS as well as its practically universal operating system and cloud-computing network. It’s difficult to imagine life without the tech juggernaut. Unsurprisingly, it has been consistently profitable.
For fiscal year 2024, analysts are seeking EPS of $11.65, well above last year’s print of $9.81. Notably, even the least-optimistic projection stands at $11.40. For revenue, we’re talking about $244.22 billion, up a massive 15.2% from last year’s haul of $211.91 billion.
I think it’s a buy, irrespective of the Nancy Pelosi connection.
American Express (AXP)
Source: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com
Even with the vaunted category of Nancy Pelosi stocks, you come across some tricky narratives. For me, that would be American Express (NYSE: AXP ). Don’t get me wrong – I think it’s a fine company. You never leave home without it, am I right? Still, with so many Americans indebted (to the tune of over $1 trillion), I’m a bit concerned about credit-card companies.
Let’s get that out of the way first. Having said that, let me also say that if I had to invest in a credit card company, it would be AXP stock. Why? American Express generally caters to a wealthier clientele. And so, even with rising plastic delinquencies , AmEx customers should be the least impacted. It’s still a tricky play though. In the first and fourth quarters last year, the company missed analysts’ EPS targets .
Looking to the end of fiscal 2024, experts believe that AmEx will post EPS of $12.80. That’s up noticeably from last year’s print of $11.21. For revenue, we’re looking at $66.15 billion, up 9.3% from 2023’s tally of $60.52 billion.
Disney (DIS)
Source: chrisdorney / Shutterstock
To start, Disney (NYSE: DIS ) is one of the Nancy Pelosi stocks that the namesake legislator has been selling. It’s understandable. While the entertainment giant – which features an enviable content library along with a portfolio of theme parks and resorts – commands a massive brand, it has also struggled since late 2021. Still, a clear recovery is in play.
Since the beginning of the year, DIS stock gained over 35% of equity value. Over the past 52 weeks, it’s up more than 23%. Sure, at this point, it does trade at 75.81X trailing-year earnings. As well, it runs a sales premium of 2.52X last year’s revenue. Nevertheless, it’s also possible that the entertainment leader is attempting to return to its throne. I think it’s worth considering.
In Q1 2023, Disney met the analysts’ EPS target of 93 cents. From Q2 to Q4, the positive earnings surprise came out to 8.4%, then 17.1%, finally culminating at 23.2%. That’s earnings growth if I’ve ever seen it.
For fiscal 2024, analysts are looking for EPS of $4.68 against last year’s result of $3.76. Given the trend, it’s a solid wager.
Alphabet (GOOGL)
The former House speaker has both bought and sold shares of tech juggernaut Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). Most recently, she has trimmed her exposure to GOOGL stock. Still, even without her direct show of support, I think it’s one of the Nancy Pelosi stocks to consider. Yes, GOOGL has enjoyed a solid run, moving up 48% in the past 52 weeks. There could still be more gains to be had.
One of the criticisms against Alphabet is that it’s not particularly winning the generative AI game. Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI and its chatbot ChatGPT has taken the world by storm. Alphabet’s Gemini (previously called Bard) is okay but doesn’t have first-mover advantage. Still, as I argued previously, Alphabet could eventually tweak its platform to become a true AI winner. It practically owns the internet so an exploitable synergy exists.
For fiscal 2024, covering experts believe EPS will reach $6.81. That’s a big jump from last year’s print of $5.80. Also, they’re looking for revenue to land at $342.34 billion. Again, we’re talking a large gap from last year’s result of $307.39 billion.
PayPal (PYPL)
Source: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com
Finally, we come to the riskiest idea among Nancy Pelosi stocks, financial technology (fintech) stalwart PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL ). It’s so risky that she decided to sell it. I can understand the decision and I’d say it’s worked out for her. While PYPL is up more than 5% since the beginning of the year, it’s down 14% in the trailing year. Obviously, that’s not encouraging amid wider tech bullishness.
Still, I’m not ready to abandon ship on PYPL just yet. For example, with the Covid-19 crisis imparting massive changes in the workforce, the gig economy could rise higher than expected. That would certainly be the case as more companies demand a return to the office. It’s also interesting to note that PayPal has performed quite well last year against bottom-line targets.
For fiscal year 2024, analysts are looking for EPS of $5.07. That’s a bit disappointing compared to last year’s result of $5.10. However, revenue might land at $31.86 billion. If so, that would be a 7% bump from last year’s tally of $29.77 billion. It’s worth looking into if you’re a contrarian.

Warren Buffett once remarked, “Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.” It’s a caution to investors to not just look at the cost of what a stock is charging you to buy it but to understand what you will receive for your money.
Penny stock investors quickly learn that lesson. They may be able to scoop up a lot of shares of thinly traded companies only to lose their entire investment in a pump-and-dump scheme. Meanwhile, an investment in Buffett’s own Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A , NYSE: BRK-B ) 10 years ago would have set you back a cool $187,000 for a single share but today is worth almost $632,000. Which was the better price to pay? Who got more value for their money?
Oscar Wilde phrased it a bit differently. “[A cynic] knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.” The sentiment remains the same. So, if you come across a high-priced investment, don’t dismiss it out of hand as not worth the cost. It may be a great deal regardless.
Below are three stocks priced above $1,000 and worth every penny.
Broadcom (AVGO)
Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com
Semiconductor stock Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO ) is steadily transforming itself from a chipmaker for mobile devices into an infrastructure solutions company. The closing of its acquisition of VMWare last year should be what finally allows it to happen. Broadcom expects about half of its revenue to come from infrastructure software this year.
The chipmaker has been a serial acquirer ever since Avago bought Broadcom in 2016 for $37 billion. It kept the Broadcom name and the Avago ticker symbol. In the seven years since that deal, the company sought to transition away from the cyclical chip business into the more steadfast software market. It gobbled up CA Technologies, Symantec and Brocade. Now VMWare pushes it towards completion.
Yet, Broadcom still heavily relies upon its mobile chip customers, most notably Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). The tech giant represented 20% of Broadcom’s revenue for the past two years, though it is likely to be a smaller percentage going forward.
One share of AVGO stock will set you back around $1,300. But shifting away from the mercurial semiconductor business will offer Broadcom greater clarity into where its revenue comes from and where the business is heading.
Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG)
Source: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com
Grab this one before it’s gone! Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG ) is currently priced at more than $2,800 a share, but a 50-to-1 stock split in June should bring the restaurant chain’s stock down into the $50 to $60 per share range. As nothing else changes about the business, the Mexican food company is still a growth stock to buy.
The force that drove CMG stock 63% higher last year and 225% over the past five years was the addition of drive-thru lanes at its restaurants. A surprisingly simple solution that really became imperative during the pandemic, adding Chipotlanes to its stores increased mobile digital orders. Customers could slip in and out quickly, improving Chipotle’s restaurant productivity, profit margins and returns.
In the fourth quarter, Chipotle opened 121 new locations, 110 of which had a drive-thru window. It is also retrofitting existing locations. Of the 3,400 restaurants in operation, the company expects as many as 1,000 to have a drive-thru installed.
Wall Street expects CMG earnings to grow at a 33% compound annual rate over the next five years. That makes its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 44 not wholly unwarranted. It’s likely earnings will expand at an even faster rate as more Chipotlanes are installed.
W.W. Grainger (GWW)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
Industrial toolmaker W.W. Grainger (NYSE: GWW ) is a new member of the $1,000 per share club, but this is a long, steady grower that puts the S&P 500 to shame. Over the past decade, GWW stock has given a total return of nearly 300% compared to the broad market index’s total return of around 180%.
Investors have long appreciated Grainger’s extended dividend history and increases for over 50 years, making it a Dividend King. In the last 10 years, the industrial supplier’s dividend increased at about 7% CAGR while it grew free cash flow ( FCF ) more than 8% annually. With an FCF payout ratio of less than 25%, there is plenty of room for another 50 years of increases.
The company operates in two segments: high-touch solutions ( HTS ) and endless assortment. Silly names, but descriptive of what its maintenance, repair and operations ( MRO ) customers need. The former is for customers with complex buying needs who shop at its Grainger stores, while the latter is its e-commerce platform where customers can find millions of products.
W.W. Grainger derives over 80% of its $16.5 billion in annual revenue from the HTS segment, and with growing demand, GWW stock is worth the price tag it carries.

2024-04-03,3 Tech Stocks to Sell Before the Next Market Meltdown,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Identifying opportunities and risks within the ever-evolving stock market landscape is crucial for investors aiming to make informed decisions. This research examines three well-known tech stocks and finds strong arguments for selling them before the next market correction.
Let’s start with the first one. It’s a massive social media platform with great user engagement stats, but its growth trajectory is unpredictable due to its dependency on outside variables like world events and algorithm tweaks.
While leading the way in machine vision technology, the second company needs help making money because it depends too much on declining end sectors, especially semiconductors and consumer electronics. Due to its inadequate diversification strategy, the corporation is more susceptible to industry changes.
Lastly, the third company is well-known for its innovation and market leadership. However, it sees a drop in revenue from its core goods as the competition for tablets grows. Swings further hamper sustained growth in the wearables and accessories market.
When one delves into the complexities of these tech behemoths, one finds underlying weaknesses that call for prudence.
Reddit (RDDT)
Source: Ink Drop / Shutterstock.com
Reddit (NYSE: RDDT ) depends on user engagement metrics for measuring growth and use, such as Weekly Active Unique (WAUq) and Daily Active Unique (DAUq). For instance, in Q4 2023, the global DAUq increased by 27% year-over-year (YoY). Here, the U.S. fraction is expanding by 34% YoY, and the rest of the world is growing by 21% YoY.
Similarly, in Q4, the U.S. experienced a 14% sequential rise, while the rest of the globe saw an 8% gain. Global DAUq growth was 11% compared to Q3. An inflection point may be identified by comparing the YoY and consecutive increases in the user metrics.
Fundamentally, Reddit’s user engagement ratings are unstable because of external influences, including global events, societal shifts and adjustments to search engine algorithms. For example, the platform’s growth is highly dependent on outside factors, which makes steady growth uncertain. While certain occurrences, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, led to a rise in user growth, when the pandemic’s impacts decreased, there were subsequent drops.
Crucially, logged-out users make up a sizable amount of Reddit’s incremental user growth; these individuals do not earn at the same pace as logged-in users. As of 2023, 75% of the new users recruited since July 2023 were logged out. Hence, this has presented difficulties for revenue generation and monetization.
Cognex (CGNX)
Source: shutterstock.com/rafapress
When comparing quarterly and yearly results, Cognex ‘s (NASDAQ: CGNX ) revenue decreased in almost every end market. The markets with the largest decreases were semiconductors, consumer electronics and logistics. For example, revenue in Q4 2023 fell by 18% from Q4 2022. Meanwhile, sales from China fell even more throughout the quarter, indicating a challenging economic climate.
Moreover, Cognex’s revenue problems were exacerbated by its overreliance on end sectors experiencing severe downturns , such as semiconductors and consumer electronics. The reduction in income from these areas shows the company’s poor diversification strategy and susceptibility to swings in particular industries. Even if the performance of some end markets, such as packaging and the automotive industry, was comparatively steady, it could not offset the losses in other industries.
In 2023, revenue fell in every area, with China seeing the biggest drop . China’s revenue fell even more in Q4 2023, indicative of the challenging economic climate there. Hence, Cognex’s performance in global markets, especially in China, indicates difficulties adjusting to shifting market dynamics and economic uncertainty. Overall, the company is susceptible to geopolitical and economic issues in strategic geographic regions, as highlighted by the drop in revenue from China.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: mama_mia / Shutterstock.com
With $7 billion in revenue for Q1 2024, Apple ‘s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPad revenue saw a notable 25% YoY fall. One fewer sales week and a difficult comparison with introducing new iPad models in Q1 caused this dip. Additionally, despite the iPad’s performance and adaptability, competitors’ more reasonably priced tablet options pose a greater threat to the company’s share of the tablet industry.
The drop in iPad sales highlights Apple’s inability to maintain tablet category growth . Even if iPads are still well-liked by some groups of people, such as professionals and students, the income is dropping. This suggests that retaining market share and customer interest may take time and effort. Furthermore, Apple may need help generating demand for its iPad goods as the market becomes more competitive and tablet replacement cycles extend. Hence, this would limit the company’s ability to develop quickly in this market.
Finally, the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment’s erratic revenue reveals a flaw in Apple’s capacity to sustain steady growth in this product area. For the company, wearables and accessories are a significant top-line source. Therefore, their susceptibility to seasonal fluctuations and launch cycles makes quick expansion difficult.

2024-04-03,Tesla: Should We Get Used To Disappointment?,"Tesla, Inc. stock has fallen by nearly 30% in 2024, bringing its inclusion in the Magnificent Seven into question.
Analyst expectations for Tesla's first quarter results have been trending downward, and the company's recently released figures were worse than expected.
Despite this, Tesla's valuation remains elevated against peers in both the tech and automotive manufacturing sectors.
Background
2024 has not been kind to Tesla, Inc. ( TSLA ), the maker of electric automobiles which bulls like to brand as primarily a tech company. While the broader S&P 500 (SP500, SPY) has returned 10% year-to-date, Tesla's stock has fallen by nearly 30%....",35

The highest-yield 10 stocks are April’s Dogs of the Dow: GS, JNJ, KO, AMGN, CSCO, IBM, CVX, DOW, MMM, and VZ. They only averaged a 3.97% annual yield, as prices.
Thirty Dow stocks represent nine of eleven sectors. Dow Jones tracks utilities as a separate index and omits real estate. Broker top-ten target-estimated April net gains ranged from 11.38%-26.62%, topped by BA 3/28/24.
Dow Industrial Index top-ten firms by broker target-price upside, JNJ; CRM; MSFT, CVX, AMZN, MCD, AAPL, UNH, NKE, and BA, averaged 15.96%.
Analyst one-year targets showed ten highest-yield Dow stocks producing 9.75% more gain from $5k invested in the lowest-priced five than from the same investment in all ten. Lower-priced (“little” Dow dogs) lead the pack by nearly one length into April.
Foreword
While two-thirds of this collection of Dow Industrials is too pricey and reveals only skinny dividends, one of the five lowest-priced Dogs of the Dow is ready to buy. This month, only Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ ), lives up to the dogcatcher ideal of annual dividends from $1K invested exceeding their single share prices.

2024-04-03,7 Nasdaq Stocks to Sell in April Before They Crash & Burn,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The Nasdaq is absolutely on fire. The broad macroeconomic picture has been about as good as it could get for growth stocks .
The economy is not too hot and it’s not too cold. Inflation is coming down, and the Federal Reserve may be set for interest rate cuts later this year, even as asset prices remain strong.
As a result, traders are piling into Nasdaq stocks. We’ve seen momentum trades break out to the upside in categories such a semiconductors and artificial intelligence. This all makes sense from a macroeconomic perspective.
But not all of these surging Nasdaq stocks are going to see continued prosperity. In fact, many appear to be setting up for steep declines once the current hype cycle wears off. These are seven Nasdaq stocks to sell before they really start to tank.
Nasdaq Stocks to Sell in April: Apple (AAPL)
Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is a great example of how investors have assigned high valuations to many leading Nasdaq stocks for years.
Investors have viewed Apple as a safe haven. There was no need to worry about its lofty valuation because it had a dominant hold on the smartphone market. It was considered a defensive stock and folks bought AAPL shares without any concerns around interest rates or a potential recession.
You could say that Apple has an effective tax on the communications market. The problem should be evident now that the government is taking aim at its purported monopoly on high-end smartphones.
Apple’s defensive nature has been called into question. Only time will tell if the government succeeds in limiting Apple’s allegedly monopolistic powers or perhaps even breaking up the company entirely. Regardless, 27 times earnings seems excessive for a business that has barely grown in recent years and which has a huge amount of exposure to the struggling Chinese market .
Apple stock is suddenly quite a terrifying thing to hold at this elevated starting valuation. Traders should use the antitrust lawsuit news to exit AAPL stock before its overvaluation is exposed.
Tesla (TSLA)
Source: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com
At first glance Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) might not seem like the most obvious Nasdaq stock set to plummet.
After all, hasn’t Tesla already dropped dramatically, at least, in comparison with the rest of the market?
The thing is, however, that Tesla was starting from an exceedingly high valuation. It had a triple-digit price-to-earnings ( P/E ) ratio at various points in recent years. That’s a simply ludicrous level for what is, at its core, a car manufacturing company.
Tesla has now pulled back to about 50 times earnings which is less egregious than before. But 50 times earnings is still a huge number for an automotive firm.
Furthermore, there’s no guarantee that those earnings will grow either. If anything, with the price cuts and mountains of competition in the EV space , earnings could be set for a considerable decline in coming years. Elon Musk’s erratic behavior on social media could also dissuade potential Tesla buyers. Multiple analysts have also downgraded TSLA stock recently .
All this suggests that the Tesla stock could plunge much further in a Nasdaq bear market.
Nasdaq Stocks to Sell in April: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) is one of the companies that has been central to the recent artificial intelligence ( AI ) and semiconductor themes.
AMD has been a longtime rival to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) across various markets. Traders are hoping that AMD will be able to cash in on some of the same trends that have powered Nvidia’s exponential rise over the past year.
Many bears have been quick to say Nvidia is a bubble stock selling at an unfathomable valuation. However, say what you will about the sustainability of Nvidia’s business, but it is earning a ton of money right now.
AMD by contrast has been far slower in launching its AI products. And as a result, its profitability is limited to say the least. While AMD now has a nearly $300 billion market capitalization it is earning less than $1 billion per year of net income. This puts it at a shocking 345 times trailing earnings. Shares also go for 13 times revenues and a jaw dropping 260 times free cash flow. These are figures that make even the dot-com stocks of the 2000 bubble look reasonable by comparison.
Perhaps the AI boom will be strong enough and persist long enough that even the second-tier slow-to-market companies like AMD will eventually cash in. If not, however, AMD stock seems set for a crash so large it will be recorded in the history books.
Costco (COST)
Source: ARTYOORAN / Shutterstock.com
It might be a surprise to hear that Costco (NASDAQ: COST ) is a Nasdaq stock at risk of major downside. What’s Costco doing on the Nasdaq in the first place?
While the Nasdaq is mostly tech-oriented growth stocks, there are some names from other sectors as well, including club retailer Costco. Indeed, COST stock is part of the flagship Nasdaq 100 Index. And like many of its peers, Costco has become wildly overvalued.
Costco recently reached $750 per share. That’s a gigantic move given that the stock was under $500 not all that long ago. In total, the stock is up 54% over the past year. This has pushed COST stock up to a baffling 46 times this year’s estimated earnings.
Meanwhile, analysts are projecting just 5% revenue growth for the year and the firm just missed earnings last quarter. As a brick-and-mortar retailer there’s only so much Costco can do to grow. It has already built stores in most of the best possible locations. Costco is not a particularly strong player in e-commerce, limiting growth from that channel as well.
It’s a mature company that has significant limits to growth. Investors are about to discover that paying 46 times earnings for a slow-growing retailer usually doesn’t end well. A tech company may be able to grow its way out of this sort of inflated P/E multiple. A big box store almost certainly will not.
Nasdaq Stocks to Sell in April: Monster Beverage (MNST)
Source: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.com
Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST ) is another one of the more surprising companies in the Nasdaq 100 Index. Despite not being a tech company, however, Monster has certainly proven to be a quality growth stock over the years. Shares are up more than 400% over the past decade.
However, Monster may now be living off its past accomplishments. The energy drink market is saturated. The U.S. market and various international markets now have tremendous distribution of energy drinks and there are fewer new consumers left to reach.
Monster also benefited from strong consumer spending as the economy came roaring hot out of the lockdowns. But that tailwind will let up at some point, particularly as consumers struggle with the impacts of higher inflation and food prices.
Monster also faces more competition . In particular, Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH ) has created a highly competitive product that has shown absolutely sizzling growth in recent years. In many ways, Celsius today could be what Monster was 10 or 15 years ago.
Monster is now a mature company with a much slower growth rate. As such, MNST stock’s 35 P/E multiple is far too high as it runs out of juice.
Airbnb (ABNB)
Source: AlesiaKan / Shutterstock.com
Compared to many of the companies on this list, Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB ) might seem like a relative value at around 25 times earnings. The travel and hospitality company has built a strong platform around sharing homes and apartment rooms.
The company also did a tremendous job of maintaining its business’ core advantages during the Covid disruption and it has fully cashed in on the travel recovery trend of the past few years. But the growth is coming to an end.
Airbnb is no longer a plucky newcomer. Nowadays, most savvy travelers are quite familiar with Airbnb and either regularly use the platform or have rejected it for one reason or another. Growth will be much harder to come by as Airbnb can’t grow simply from word-of-mouth advertising anymore.
There’s also increasing pushback as Airbnb’s prices have escalated . Oftentimes Airbnb is more expensive than just using a hotel nowadays. Consumers are complaining about excessive fees, cleaning costs, and so on.
Finally, there’s a great deal of regulatory pushback. Cities like New York and Barcelona have put severe limitations in place on Airbnb’s business model. It’s not just a couple of huge cities, either. Increasingly even cities in emerging markets such as Medellin, Colombia are greatly limiting the short-term rental market.
Combine a slowing travel sector, increasingly expensive product, and mounting regulatory pushback – that’s a recipe for significant declining Airbnb share price.
Dexcom (DXCM)
Source: FOOTAGE VECTOR PHOTO / Shutterstock.com
Do you remember the weight loss drug phenomenon from last fall? How GLP-1 drugs were going to wipe out packaged foods companies, alcohol producers , and more? The knives were also out for the healthcare companies that treated people with obesity and diabetes.
Fast forward six months, and it’s as if that risk never happened. Diabetes monitoring and management company Dexcom (NASDAQ: DXCM ) is a leading example of this.
Dexcom shares fell more than 30% last fall as analyst suggested that fewer people would use the company’s glucose monitoring solutions thanks to the weight loss drugs. Some people were suggesting that the whole diabetes management field might become obsolete.
The claims around the speed and efficacy of the weight loss drugs were probably hyperbolic to a degree. That said, there is something real. The GLP-1 drugs are still gaining momentum – more people are taking these drugs as doctors are becoming comfortable with prescribing them.
As long as the trend toward GLP-1 drug usages continues, that should help limit the population of folks dealing with chronic diabetes. This, in turn, will have an impact on Dexcom’s available market for glucose monitoring solutions.
DXCM stock has regained all of its losses since last year. That seems overdone given the longer-term questions to the business model. As if that weren’t enough, Dexcom shares are trading for more than 60 times forward earnings.

The $1 trillion valuation implies sizable gains for the investments on this list. The jump may require a 30% to 50% increase for these promising tech stocks . Some of them have the potential to become trillion-dollar stocks by the end of the year, while others may reach the milestone by 2030.
These are some of the top tech stocks set to join the trillion-dollar club.
Broadcom (AVGO)
Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com
Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO ) is the easiest choice on this list. The semiconductor giant has the largest market cap of these picks and comes in with a $633 billion market cap. The company’s 50 P/E ratio and artificial intelligence ( AI ) tailwinds can give it the extra momentum it needs to attain trillion-dollar status.
The stock is surrounded by enthusiasts, as it is currently rated a Strong Buy. The lowest price target still implies some upside, while the average price target indicates a 16% gain is in the cards. The highest price target of $1,720 per share suggests the stock could gain an additional 26% from current levels.
Broadcom’s recent acquisition of VMware has already translated into higher revenue growth. Revenue increased by 34% year-over-year (YoY), and the company believes it can exceed $50 billion in fiscal 2024 revenue. The corporation helped itself toward this goal by repurchasing $8.29 billion worth of shares.
Visa (V)
Source: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com
Visa (NYSE: V ) is a fintech company that offers credit and debit cards. The company makes a small percentage of every credit and debit card transaction. Many investors use Visa’s financial reports as an indicator of broader U.S. economic performance.
Visa gave its investors and broader market participants reasons to cheer in its latest earnings report. Revenue increased by 9% YoY in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. GAAP net income was up by 17% YoY, reaching $4.9 billion. Those growth rates helped the company bring in a 56.6% net profit margin.
Visa stock is up by 76% over the past five years and has momentum on its side. The stock is up 7% year-to-date and 21% over the past year. The stock trades at a $572 billion market cap, more than halfway toward the trillion-dollar milestone. Visa shares trade at a 32 P/E ratio and offer a 0.75% yield.
Adobe (ADBE)

Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) would have to more than quadruple to reach a $1 trillion market cap, so investors will have to be very patient with this one. The stock has a $224 billion market cap and a 48 P/E ratio. Shares are up by 86% over the past five years.
Adobe generates recurring revenue from its popular software products. Creatives and businesses use Adobe’s products to create captivating graphics and videos. The company’s video editing tools are some of the best in the industry.
Adobe recently reported Q1 fiscal 2024 results. Revenue reached a record $5.18 billion. That’s 11% higher than the same period last year. Diluted EPS came to $1.36 on a GAAP basis. Adobe closed the quarter with $17.58 billion in remaining performance obligations, a healthy backlog. The company tapped into its financial strength to repurchase 3.1 million shares in the quarter.

2024-04-04,Cashing in on the Bitcoin Bounce: 3 Stocks to Buy for Indirect Crypto Exposure,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
You’re at the right place if you’re seeking stocks for indirect crypto exposure. While Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETFs are witnessing unprecedented inflows and nudging towards all-time highs, not all investors are convinced of crypto viability as a long-term investment. For instance, Vanguard Group executives view Bitcoin as too speculative for inclusion in buy-and-hold portfolios (hence their lack of interest in launching a Bitcoin ETF). But, even for crypto skeptics, opportunities for indirect crypto exposure and traditional stock stability abound.
Investing in companies with significant involvement in blockchain-related activities provides indirect exposure to crypto while allowing for diversification across various applications beyond blockchain, such as identity verification and contract settlements.
The rising interest in artificial intelligence has overshadowed blockchain technologies, yet companies in this space present numerous investment opportunities with substantial long-term growth potential. These investments allow those hesitant about direct cryptocurrency investments to benefit from Bitcoin’s performance. They may also provide superior returns compared to direct cryptocurrency holdings over an extended period.
Stocks for Indirect Crypto Exposure: MercadoLibre (MELI)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
Crypto’s popularity is surging in Latin America, with countries like El Salvador integrating Bitcoin into their legal tender system. MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI ), an Argentinian e-commerce giant, is contributing to this trend by introducing its own cryptocurrency, akin to PayPal’s (NASDAQ: PYPL ) strategy, to offer shareholders indirect crypto exposure. In addition to its proprietary Mercado coin, MercadoLibre is capitalizing on the broader blockchain movement by providing a digital wallet that enables crypto trading across multiple assets, including Bitcoin.
MercadoLibre’s value extends beyond its indirect crypto exposure to diversify shareholder interests, as it remains a significant force in Latin America’s wider eCommerce sector. The company has reported consistent revenue and net income growth over the last five quarters , with sales nearing $15 billion by the end of 2023. Moreover, MercadoLibre’s management excels at managing debt, a notable achievement among tech and rapidly expanding eCommerce companies. This financial prudence is crucial for navigating the economic instability in Latin American markets, safeguarding the company and its investors.
Broadcom (AVGO)
Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com
Among its multiple revenue streams, Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO ) assists business owners with incorporating blockchain technology into their daily operations. The tech stock distinguishes itself by focusing on blockchain integration’s essential infrastructure and security aspects, providing the backbone to adopt, integrate, and manage the tech across various applications . Broadcom is diversifying its revenue streams by moving towards blockchain services and addressing previous concerns about revenue concentration, especially following its VMware merger .
Previously, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) contributed to more than 20% of Broadcom’s revenue through its 5G and wireless component segments. However, with the synergies from VMware’s cloud computing and a focus on blockchain technology, Broadcom is lessening its dependence on revenue from a single source. Investors should note that integrating VMware will incur about $1 billion in transaction costs in the short term. Nevertheless, like adopting blockchain technology, this temporary volatility is a worthwhile investment for indirect crypto exposure.
SBI Holdings Inc (SBHGF)
Source: Vit-Mar / Shutterstock.com
SBI Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS: SBHGF ), a vast Japanese conglomerate, operates across various sectors, including financial services, asset management, healthcare data, and biotechnology. However, the company’s indirect crypto exposure potential primarily stems from its “ crypto-asset business .” This venture integrates a variety of crypto-related and blockchain initiatives to enhance the SBI Group’s financial ecosystem in preparation for an increasingly digital finance landscape.
The company has committed up to $100 million in investments to global crypto startups, offering essential funding to smaller firms challenged by the high interest rates that render debt financing exceedingly costly. Moreover, investors can take comfort in SBI’s diverse range of services, contributing to its steady profitability , a claim supported by its decently high dividend yield .
Shares dipped late last year amid accusations of stock manipulation that, thus far, haven’t been borne out by investigators. Shares are slowly returning to past highs, but it isn’t too late to get indirect crypto exposure from this unique stock.

2024-04-04,Hidden Gem Alert: Why Baidu Stock Is a Bargain Buy for Savvy Investors,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Sometimes, you have to expand your geographic horizons to find the best deals in the financial markets. A case in point is Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ) shares, which are trading at a discount right now. Don’t expect Baidu stock to be underpriced for much longer, though, as the company could soon strike a deal with a famous smartphone manufacturer.
Based in China, Baidu is a search-engine market dominator that also specializes in artificial intelligence technology. You might not know this, but Baidu also launched the first 24/7 robo-taxi service in China. It’s a fascinating company that’s not a darling on Wall Street – but that’s exactly why value seekers should be in a mood to buy BIDU stock now.
Baidu Stock Is Cheap Despite the Company’s Revenue Growth
How cheap is Baidu stock now? It’s been as high as $150 multiple times during the past several years, but recently only traded at around $105.
During a time when the U.S. market is hyper-focused on the “Magnificent Seven,” Baidu is an undervalued business. Baidu’s GAAP trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is 13.51x , versus the sector median P/E ratio of 19.52x.
Baidu, like the “Mag-7” companies, is heavily involved in AI technology. Baidu isn’t in financial trouble. You might think the company is in bad shape, based on the share-price action. However, Baidu’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 revenue actually grew 6% year over year to 34,951 RMB .
In addition, Baidu’s full-year 2023 revenue increased 9% YOY to 134.6 billion RMB. Remember, investors shouldn’t try to compare Baidu’s revenue growth to that of U.S.-based Magnificent Seven companies.
China’s economy, without a doubt, has faced significant challenges and this makes Baidu’s sales growth all the more impressive.
Baidu Could Soon Have an Agreement With Apple
Another pillar of the bull case for Baidu stock is the company’s potential agreement with well-known smartphone manufacturer Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). If you’re still on the fence, this news item ought to convince you to invest in Baidu while the company is still undervalued.
Here’s the scoop. According to The Wall Street Journal , Apple “ held preliminary talks with” Baidu about the possibility of using Baidu’s generative-AI technology in Apple’s devices in China.
This team up, if it happens, would benefit both companies. Apple’s AI-enhanced devices would be more likely to satisfy China-based regulators’ inspections and requirements. As for Baidu, the company would have a powerful, capital-rich and globally recognized partner.
Baidu Stock: This Sounds Like the Deal of a Lifetime
Could this be the best tech-sector deal of 2024? No, I’m not talking about the potential deal between Baidu and Apple, though that would certainly be monumental if it happens.
Rather, I’m referring to the unbeatable deal you can get right now with Baidu stock. The shares are reasonably valued, and Baidu recently demonstrated solid revenue growth. Hence, I encourage you to think globally and, before the opportunity passes you by, put some Baidu shares in your portfolio.
